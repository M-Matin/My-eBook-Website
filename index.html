            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <blockquote>“How do we deal with accessibility needs for which there are no definitive answers?”&nbsp;</blockquote>
            <p>asks Eleanor Ratliff. Sometimes we arrive at a fix that helps one group of people only to find that our solution undermines another group’s experience. Through the prism of typeface choice, Ratliff relates how she and her team tackled the problem of accessibility whack-a-mole for a rebranding project.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/spartan" target="_blank">Richard Fink</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;September 06, 2016</p>
            <p>Richard Fink first wrote about webfonts for A List Apart in 2010. Back then, those of us making the web were itching to break away from so-called “web-safe” fonts. And break away we did: by 2016, roughly 60 percent of sites were reportedly using webfonts, up from just two percent in 2011. Webfonts and, by extension, web typography, have blossomed. So surely no one would argue for a return to system fonts, right? Wrong. This article teases apart the arguments for and against.</p>

            <p>Type on the web has come a long way since the beginning of the decade. We now have literally thousands of fonts at our disposal to use on our sites. But the same faces—the Futuras, the Gothams, the Proxima Novas—crop up everywhere. Jeremiah Shoaf encourages us to break out of our cognitive ruts and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-rich-typefaces-get-richer" target="_blank">explore</a> the wealth of typographic diversity at our fingertips.</p>

            <p>The dog days are upon us—but instead of giving up in the summer swelter, take heart! We’ve got an extra-special reading list of bright, insightful brainfood. ALA’s third annual summer reader explores what’s been on the web industry’s mind lately, from accessibility to performance, from CSS techniques to web type, from mentorship to more collaborative approaches. It’s a list as cool and fancy as a watermelon-basil popsicle. Yeah, that does sound good, doesn’t it? Kick back, chill out, and get to reading.</p>

            <p>Displays that are more tiny than our lowest-size breakpoints require a more condensed range of type sizes. If you don’t already have in place a typographic system that can absorb the demands of this new context (watches, wearables, digital sticky notes, whatever), now might be the time to consider it. Matt Griffin was ready for anything because his <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/readable-wearables" target="_blank">site</a> was simple and built to be future friendly.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/Aetherpoint" target="_blank">Andrew Johnson</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;January 20, 2015</p>
            <p>We all want to design great typographic experiences—while serving users on a huge array of devices. But today’s type is inflexible and doesn’t scale. We can solve this problem by making webfonts more systemized and context-aware, and live web font interpolation—the modification of a font’s design in the browser—can help us get there. Andrew Johnson points the way.</p>

            <p>When you read, you filter text through your experiences and past conversations. You put words into context. You interpret. So how can we use typography to welcome readers and convince them to sit with us through this process? A List Apart alum Jason Santa Maria explains in this excerpt from Chapter 1 of On Web Typography, his new book from A Book Apart.</p>

            <p>A style guide, also referred to as a pattern library, is a living document that details the front-end code for all the elements and modules of a website or application. It also documents the site’s visual language, from header styles to color palettes. In short, a proper style guide is a one-stop guide that the entire team can reference when considering site changes and iterations. Susan Robertson shows us how to build and maintain a style guide that helps everyone from product owners and producers to designers and developers keep an ever-changing site on brand and on target.</p>

            <p>For ideal <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/responsive-typography-is-a-physical-discipline" target="_blank">typography</a>, web designers need to know as much as possible about each user’s reading environment. That may seem obvious, but the act of specifying web typography is currently like ordering slices of pizza without knowing how large the slices are or what toppings they are covered with.</p>

            <p>Minimalism in design has been around for some time, and today it seems to be a welcome alternative to overly busy and unnecessarily cluttered websites, posters, ads, and logos. For those new to this art form, the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">minimalism</a>&nbsp;is mostly concerned with stripping away excess and strategically placing remaining elements. The result can be a calming, yet powerful design that is streamlined to convey its message. You can find minimalism in all art forms, from architecture to fashion to logo design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>To get the most out of a minimalist design, whether it be for something as small as a logo or large as a billboard, be sure to use the right elements correctly. Color, layout, white space, graphics &amp;&nbsp; typography all play an important role in minimalism. Below we look at these&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/06/13/how-to-design-learn-the-basics/" target="_blank">principles of design</a>&nbsp;and how they relate to minimalism.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalist Color Choices</strong></h3>
            <p>In minimalist design, color choice is strategic and the amount of colors used, should be kept to a minimum. Black, grey and white are the most powerful colors and allow for a single accent color to have a greater impact.</p>
            <p>All colors are acceptable if they are used properly; however, the colors with the greatest contrast are generally used together. Therefore, most designers choose bold and bright primary colours for minimalist design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Effective Minimalist Layout</strong></h3>
            <p>A minimalist design layout is especially challenging because every element with which you are working, is essential. Content for&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2011/03/01/web-design-tips-advice-from-a-to-z/" target="_blank">websites</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/05/13/how-to-design-a-movie-poster-with-an-example/" target="_blank">posters</a>&nbsp;should be laid out in such a way that the viewer can find what they need without much thought. In other words, the page should make sense.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/14_jan-reichle-website-500x232.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>White Space</strong></h3>
            <p>Negative space serves to give power to the small bits of information that it surrounds. The greater the empty space, the more power an object within it gains.&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/" target="_blank">Negative space</a>&nbsp;also serves to structure a group of elements and create balance.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/08_lady-gaga-poster-325x400.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p>The use of images in minimalism is very intentional. Designers choose graphics for their effectiveness and in minimalist design use them when the image is more effective than a written message. Graphics should be used sparingly and strategically, and should be relevant to the topic.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/11_lachlan-bailey-website-500x231.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography in minimalism should be just as strategic as any other element. In any design including minimalism, no more than two or three styles of fonts are appropriate. Many designs use one font for headlines, one for body, and possibly one for navigation on websites or for any special text or subheadings. Usually more than three types makes the design look cluttered and hard to understand.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/15_butterflies-remember-poster-283x400.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalism on the Web</strong></h3>
            <p>In the last ten years, minimalist website design has become quite trendy. Unfortunately, some designers have misunderstood the idea behind minimalism and create web pages void of content that simply don’t make sense. However, at the root of the minimalist movement, great designers have created stunning websites that are not only pleasing to look at, but are also easy to navigate. While minimalist design is not practical nor thematically possible for every every website, those websites that can use it should take advantage.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/17_up-and-onward-website-500x223.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in the Media</h3>
            <p>Brochures, packaging, and ad campaigns have all seen their share of the minimalist design. However, it is in posters and logos that you see it really take hold. Many designers choose to use this streamlined design for everything from movie posters, to band posters, to ad posters. The reason for this is the effectiveness of conveying a strong message quickly and cleanly. Used correctly, minimalist posters are designed to use each of its elements to send one message. The result is usually a poster that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/20_the-buggles-poster-283x400.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in logos</h3>
            <p>Minimalism in&nbsp;<a href="http://logooftheday.com/" target="_blank">logos</a>&nbsp;is an important concept, since the purpose of a logo is to be easily remembered and associated with a company. As a result, minimalist logos are often the most popular type of logo design since it keeps the logo simple enough to be memorable. The tricky part of a minimalist logo is to make a design that is easily recognised for the company it represents, while also reflecting the brand’s goals.</p>

            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>
