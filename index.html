            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
