            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <p>Communicating via typefaces. Fonts and layout. Designing for readers. Legibility. Web Fonts: there’s life after Georgia and Verdana. Using CSS @font-face to embed licensed fonts on your site. Typekit and other solutions. Controlling web typography: size, font, color. CSS methods, browser problems, user problems, and workarounds.

            <blockquote>“How do we deal with accessibility needs for which there are no definitive answers?”&nbsp;</blockquote>
            <p>asks Eleanor Ratliff. Sometimes we arrive at a fix that helps one group of people only to find that our solution undermines another group’s experience. Through the prism of typeface choice, Ratliff relates how she and her team tackled the problem of accessibility whack-a-mole for a rebranding project.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/spartan" target="_blank">Richard Fink</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;September 06, 2016</p>
            <p>Richard Fink first wrote about webfonts for A List Apart in 2010. Back then, those of us making the web were itching to break away from so-called “web-safe” fonts. And break away we did: by 2016, roughly 60 percent of sites were reportedly using webfonts, up from just two percent in 2011. Webfonts and, by extension, web typography, have blossomed. So surely no one would argue for a return to system fonts, right? Wrong. This article teases apart the arguments for and against.</p>

            <p>Type on the web has come a long way since the beginning of the decade. We now have literally thousands of fonts at our disposal to use on our sites. But the same faces—the Futuras, the Gothams, the Proxima Novas—crop up everywhere. Jeremiah Shoaf encourages us to break out of our cognitive ruts and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-rich-typefaces-get-richer" target="_blank">explore</a> the wealth of typographic diversity at our fingertips.</p>

            <p>The dog days are upon us—but instead of giving up in the summer swelter, take heart! We’ve got an extra-special reading list of bright, insightful brainfood. ALA’s third annual summer reader explores what’s been on the web industry’s mind lately, from accessibility to performance, from CSS techniques to web type, from mentorship to more collaborative approaches. It’s a list as cool and fancy as a watermelon-basil popsicle. Yeah, that does sound good, doesn’t it? Kick back, chill out, and get to reading.</p>

            <p>Displays that are more tiny than our lowest-size breakpoints require a more condensed range of type sizes. If you don’t already have in place a typographic system that can absorb the demands of this new context (watches, wearables, digital sticky notes, whatever), now might be the time to consider it. Matt Griffin was ready for anything because his <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/readable-wearables" target="_blank">site</a> was simple and built to be future friendly.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/Aetherpoint" target="_blank">Andrew Johnson</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;January 20, 2015</p>
            <p>We all want to design great typographic experiences—while serving users on a huge array of devices. But today’s type is inflexible and doesn’t scale. We can solve this problem by making webfonts more systemized and context-aware, and live web font interpolation—the modification of a font’s design in the browser—can help us get there. Andrew Johnson points the way.</p>

            <p>When you read, you filter text through your experiences and past conversations. You put words into context. You interpret. So how can we use typography to welcome readers and convince them to sit with us through this process? A List Apart alum Jason Santa Maria explains in this excerpt from Chapter 1 of On Web Typography, his new book from A Book Apart.</p>

            <p>A style guide, also referred to as a pattern library, is a living document that details the front-end code for all the elements and modules of a website or application. It also documents the site’s visual language, from header styles to color palettes. In short, a proper style guide is a one-stop guide that the entire team can reference when considering site changes and iterations. Susan Robertson shows us how to build and maintain a style guide that helps everyone from product owners and producers to designers and developers keep an ever-changing site on brand and on target.</p>

            <p>For ideal <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/responsive-typography-is-a-physical-discipline" target="_blank">typography</a>, web designers need to know as much as possible about each user’s reading environment. That may seem obvious, but the act of specifying web typography is currently like ordering slices of pizza without knowing how large the slices are or what toppings they are covered with.</p>

            <p>Minimalism in design has been around for some time, and today it seems to be a welcome alternative to overly busy and unnecessarily cluttered websites, posters, ads, and logos. For those new to this art form, the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">minimalism</a>&nbsp;is mostly concerned with stripping away excess and strategically placing remaining elements. The result can be a calming, yet powerful design that is streamlined to convey its message. You can find minimalism in all art forms, from architecture to fashion to logo design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>To get the most out of a minimalist design, whether it be for something as small as a logo or large as a billboard, be sure to use the right elements correctly. Color, layout, white space, graphics &amp;&nbsp; typography all play an important role in minimalism. Below we look at these&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/06/13/how-to-design-learn-the-basics/" target="_blank">principles of design</a>&nbsp;and how they relate to minimalism.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalist Color Choices</strong></h3>
            <p>In minimalist design, color choice is strategic and the amount of colors used, should be kept to a minimum. Black, grey and white are the most powerful colors and allow for a single accent color to have a greater impact.</p>
            <p>All colors are acceptable if they are used properly; however, the colors with the greatest contrast are generally used together. Therefore, most designers choose bold and bright primary colours for minimalist design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Effective Minimalist Layout</strong></h3>
            <p>A minimalist design layout is especially challenging because every element with which you are working, is essential. Content for&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2011/03/01/web-design-tips-advice-from-a-to-z/" target="_blank">websites</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/05/13/how-to-design-a-movie-poster-with-an-example/" target="_blank">posters</a>&nbsp;should be laid out in such a way that the viewer can find what they need without much thought. In other words, the page should make sense.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/14_jan-reichle-website-500x232.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>White Space</strong></h3>
            <p>Negative space serves to give power to the small bits of information that it surrounds. The greater the empty space, the more power an object within it gains.&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/" target="_blank">Negative space</a>&nbsp;also serves to structure a group of elements and create balance.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p>The use of images in minimalism is very intentional. Designers choose graphics for their effectiveness and in minimalist design use them when the image is more effective than a written message. Graphics should be used sparingly and strategically, and should be relevant to the topic.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography in minimalism should be just as strategic as any other element. In any design including minimalism, no more than two or three styles of fonts are appropriate. Many designs use one font for headlines, one for body, and possibly one for navigation on websites or for any special text or subheadings. Usually more than three types makes the design look cluttered and hard to understand.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="">

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalism on the Web</strong></h3>
            <p>In the last ten years, minimalist website design has become quite trendy. Unfortunately, some designers have misunderstood the idea behind minimalism and create web pages void of content that simply don’t make sense. However, at the root of the minimalist movement, great designers have created stunning websites that are not only pleasing to look at, but are also easy to navigate. While minimalist design is not practical nor thematically possible for every every website, those websites that can use it should take advantage.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in the Media</h3>
            <p>Brochures, packaging, and ad campaigns have all seen their share of the minimalist design. However, it is in posters and logos that you see it really take hold. Many designers choose to use this streamlined design for everything from movie posters, to band posters, to ad posters. The reason for this is the effectiveness of conveying a strong message quickly and cleanly. Used correctly, minimalist posters are designed to use each of its elements to send one message. The result is usually a poster that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in logos</h3>
            <p>Minimalism in&nbsp;<a href="http://logooftheday.com/" target="_blank">logos</a>&nbsp;is an important concept, since the purpose of a logo is to be easily remembered and associated with a company. As a result, minimalist logos are often the most popular type of logo design since it keeps the logo simple enough to be memorable. The tricky part of a minimalist logo is to make a design that is easily recognised for the company it represents, while also reflecting the brand’s goals.</p>

            <h2>How to Create a Timeless Design: 7 Tips</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>The best designs never really go out of style. These classics are often rooted deep in design theory and have that certain something that helps them withstand the test of time. You know some of them – brands such as Nike and Coca-Cola have logos, colors and overall design personalities that have stood for decades.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Thankfully, that timeless concept is something you can apply to almost any project. You might not have the same visual recognition as the Swoosh, but you can create an aesthetic that can work for you for years to come. Here’s how to do it.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>1. Focus on Readable Content</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/rainn.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It starts with readable type, images and overall clarity in the design and message. While that sounds like a tall order, a focus on simplicity and readability are key.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typography needs to be readable at any size and without difficulty. Novelty typefaces can be fun for a while, but if users don’t know what you are trying to say, the design will fall short.</li>
              <li>Images should be sharp, of high quality and easy to understand. Just as typography needs to be readable, all other visuals must be read as well. Can the user understand what is happening in the image and how it relates to what you are trying to say?</li>
              <li>The design needs to look good, but should provide a clear message or meaning. Images, text and user actions should create an integrated experience that users understand and want to be a part of. If the parts are asynchronous and disjointed, even a beautiful design can fail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Incorporate Interactivity</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/bangui.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Once you put all the visual elements together, users should want to interact with it. This doesn’t mean you have to create a virtual reality experience – although you could. Even small touches of interaction can make a design feel more realistic and add to the personality of the project.</p>
            <p>When thinking about interactive elements, design for usability and usefulness. Interactivity should do something that can’t be done in another way. It might be how you tell a story, a thoughtful navigation pattern or a bit of movement or action just to delight users.</p>
            <p>Set a goal for the interactive visual, keep it simple and smooth and make sure it works with your content plan for maximum impact.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>3. Create a Visual Scale</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/wekiwi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Every website needs a hierarchy of elements. Big items, regular-sized elements and small pieces. Each of these elements needs a place in the design with plenty of space to differentiate it from other parts of the visual display.</p>
            <p>A good visual scale provides a way to proportionately design and place elements – from type to space to size – so that everything seems to fit in a logical manner.</p>
            <p>A good scale creates flow in a pattern that’s easy for the user to recognize and work with. (There’s a reason that most website have a left-top logo, large image and then body text. It provides a visual scale that shows users how to read the content.)</p>
            <p>Just as important as the scale and weight of items are the consistency in use. If a button is one color and size on the homepage, it should have the same design on other pages. Body text, headlines and color choices should follow rules of consistency across pages as well.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. Accent Elements with Purpose</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/felt.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>The most lasting designs have a little something extra to set them off from everything else. Accent elements with a purpose, use color in interesting ways and include touches of flair that are a little more modern and keep the design from feeling stark.</p>
            <p>Accents include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Special bits of typography</li>
              <li>Interesting pops of color</li>
              <li>Simple animations</li>
              <li>An unusual texture of background</li>
              <li>Almost anything unexpected</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of accents as little surprises that help direct users through the design. They should provide direction and informational understanding about the content as well as provide visual interest.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>5. Establish Identity</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/penguins.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Every part of your visual identity should look like your brand. This applies to everything from your website to business cards to photo and logos on social media. Users should know who you are just by looking and not have to wonder if they wandered into content by mistake.</p>
            <p>This brand identity is important – vital, actually. Creating a brand identity is a giant undertaking and if you don’t have one already, it should be on your radar. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help create visual identity and consistency.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the same colors.</li>
              <li>Stick to a handful of fonts and sizes.</li>
              <li>Consider alignment rules for text and pick a style.</li>
              <li>Establish a photo style – color vs. black and white vs. another technique.</li>
              <li>Stick to the same voice for messaging – formal vs. casual.</li>
              <li>Be yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>6. Forget the Gimmicks</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/babygi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Designs that are too trendy can fade out of fashion fast. They can also date the design so it looks like it came from a certain time period. That’s not to discourage the use of trends, though; just use them smartly.</p>
            <p>Timeless design patterns are rooted in design theory. Basic principles and guidelines shape how the visual outline comes together. Consider that in relationship to trends. How well do they mesh? One of the reasons Material Design concepts – a big trend – seems to work so well is that it is rooted in physical ideals and motion. It takes a two-dimensional idea and pushes it forward.</p>
            <p>Using a specific typeface, complicated plugin or animation or color palette are visual ideas that you should think about. How long will the look fresh and relevant? Or do you have a plan to switch these elements out while keeping the rest of the design? You can be trendy and timeless!</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>7. Use a Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/aussie-ballet.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Proper organization never goes out of style. From a simple grid to a grid-based visual display, a strong grill provides the foundation for a solid design.</p>
            <p>When thinking about and planning a grid, think vertically and horizontally. Often designers spend a lot of time on the columnar spacing and vertical issues lurk in the design. A good grid provides enough flexibility to create and place elements with ease in a way that create harmony and flow. It also provides a guideline for spacing (including white space) and alignment of elements and parts.</p>
            <p>The grid can influence every visual aspect of the design from the size of photos and type to how icons or buttons line up with other content. The grid can be as complicated or simple as the project dictates, but should be enforced with every design element to maintain visual consistency.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Timeless design isn’t about specific techniques; it is about making design choices that are balanced, logical and easy for users to comprehend. While trendy elements can be a lot of fun, more timeless projects use a mix of classic and modern elements to share information in a directed way.</p>
            <p>When you want to create something that will last a long time, the best idea is to go back to the basics. Almost all lasting design concepts are rooted in theories that have been used for a long time.</p>

            <h2>How Does a User See Design?</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s often a disconnect between the way a designer looks at a website or brochure or package and the way users see it. As a designer, you can appreciate trends and attention to typography and details in a way that the common user might not.</em>

            <p>Users only know whether they understand something when they interact with it. The details of how that interaction happens or why it is pleasing are often lost. It’s a pretty harsh reality.
            </p>
            <p>But there’s a nugget of wisdom in understanding that disconnect. If you think about what users are thinking, you will be a better designer. (Even if you don’t particularly like their thoughts on design.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography is Good or Bad</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/prototyze-the-year-of-the-incubator.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Designers love typography. Beautiful characters. Long swashes. Serifs with charm.</p>
            <p>Sadly, many users don’t know Arial from Helvetica. (Nor do they care.) When it comes to type, users know one thing. Can they read it?</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean you can forget lettering in projects. It actually means quite the opposite. You need to pay even more attention to it. To keep users interested, every word, paragraph and headline must be perfectly readable. Users should not have to concentrate or think about the words to decipher them.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to ensure that words are clear, spacing is adjusted properly and every bit of the message is on clear display.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Color Often Goes Unnoticed</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/studio-dot.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Users don’t pay as much attention to color as you might expect. While designers may ponder over the difference between periwinkle and coneflower for hours, the casual user will often see blue.</p>
            <p>Now here’s the caveat: If a color changes dramatically, say from blue to yellow, users will notice. When it comes to color, big shifts in hue are what users tend to focus on.</p>
            <p>The thing that’s difficult about color is perception. People bring so many different notions and ideas to color choices. Make sure you have a general idea of common color associations and pair color in a way that’s accessible to all – consider choices that are visible for those that don’t see color well – for the safest color combinations.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Buttons Need to Be Obvious</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/alex-kot.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>There was an almost fatal flaw in ghost button trend: Users did not see the button when interacting with the design. It almost seemed to fade into the background.</p>
            <p>While this has shifted somewhat over time, and as ghost buttons became more popular, it was a real problem (and still can be in some instances). Super-trendy elements that look different from what users expect can lead to lost conversions.</p>
            <p>Calls to action – forms, buttons, links – need to obvious and follow common user patterns for the most success. Users have short attention spans and won’t stick around to “learn” an unconventional design. Make it easy for them.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism is ‘Overrated’</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/simone-viola-design-studio.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Admit it. Minimalism is one of your favorite go-to design options.</p>
            <p>While some users appreciate this simple beauty, more often it feels stark to them. “Where is everything?” they might ask.</p>
            <p>This can be a difficult hurdle to overcome. You’re likely to see this pushback in the early stages of design when working with clients that are always asking to put more “stuff” in the design – more photos, more color, more text.</p>
            <p>Try to strike a balance with nice open spaces and clean lines that don’t feel cluttered. The end result might not be purely minimal, but will be more pleasing to the client and end user.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Big Images Take Up a Lot of Space</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/brave.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>A large, interesting image will grab a user’s attention like few other things. But users don’t always agree with this statement.</p>
            <p>This is one of those situations where the user doesn’t know what they don’t know. It’s hard to compare a design with small images versus oversized options. The difference in impact is often clear for someone with that design eye.</p>
            <p>This is where you have to sell it to clients in the best interest of users. Go back to the theory that magazines and newspapers have used for years – tell users what is important. A big photo or video or illustration does that. A group of small elements often does not have the same lasting impression.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to help figure out what that first impression is supposed to be with the design. What problem are you trying to solve? What does the user need to know right away? Therein lies the answer.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>They Know Branding</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/etecc-interactive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Everyday users know a lot more about branding than they are given credit for. A user will know of a brand changes color or if the font in the logo shifts. (They might not always be able to pinpoint what’s different, but will know something has changed.)</p>
            <p>Any shift in an established brand identity can be jarring and confusing to users. That’s why it is so important to follow established rules for how to represent a brand visually. (If you are not working for a style guide, it is time to develop one now.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>It Either Works or Doesn’t</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/percept-brand-design.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Have you started to pick up on a common theme in what users perceive when they look at a design?</p>
            <p>It either works … or it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>Users seldom understand why. Users seldom care why a design works or not. If it works, they continue to engage. When it doesn’t, they abandon the design and move on to something else.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to be ahead of the user when it comes to what works or doesn’t. A good plan for user testing helps. More important are all of those design basics that you probably don’t think about. Design and color theory, user patterns, principles of typography and even speed and interaction design with websites and apps.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>It’s a lot to think about. You only thought you had to design something that looks good to you, right?</p>
            <p>The good thing that is that most clients often see the design like typical users. Many of these issues are at the root of conversations you are already having. Hopefully, now you can think about them a little differently and plan for what these users are thinking (and how to help improve the design so that it looks great to you … and them!)</p>

            <h2>5 Website Layout Ideas That Never Get Old</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s always that moment at the beginning of a website design project where you think “where do I start?” You’ll battle the desire to create something totally different and new versus something tested and reliable.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Realistically, there are a few layouts that just never get old. These patterns are generally accepted by users, easy to understand and provide a solid framework for pretty much any design and content type. Here, we’ll look at these five “timeless” website layouts and how to make the most of them for your next project.</p>
            <h3>1. Hero Image Stacked on Simple Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/armando.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>No matter the screen size, this format gives the user something to look at, scroll through and digest. While the actual specifications for this shape might changes based on device type or whether you prefer a full-width or shallow image, the sketch is roughly the same.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Hero image with text overlay</li>
              <li>2 to 4 columns with small information elements with or without icons</li>
              <li>Main body area</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design is clean, provides a strong visual presence and tends to work well with responsive frameworks regardless of breakpoint. Some alternative applications of this format are to switch a static hero header for a slider or video header.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/rodesk.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Every element has a place and there is a logical flow to following the content. The main image is the first impression that should draw users into the design and secondary elements should make users want to click around.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add bright colored icons or boxes to the column-based informational elements, or use a flat style for the user interface elements throughout the design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. One Page, One Column</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/pop-up.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>One page layouts are one of the best solutions for websites with minimal content and a single focus or message. When the message is simple, there’s not need to go crazy with the shape of the layout either. A one-column layout can be the perfect solution.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Main body area with images and text</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using this design pattern, space is a vital design element. Ensure that elements have plenty of room between them and consider using exaggerated spacing on the outside edges of the design. The risk with a one-page website is that it can feel cramped or disorganized if spacing is out of whack.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The one-page formula is best-suited for small websites. It can make the lack of content on an introductory page or simple portfolio feel weightier than it is. The format also works well for simple blogs or content plans that stick to a single format.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add parallax scrolling to make the page feel more engaging as users scroll. These simple effects can make a simple one-page design feel deeper and more robust (and like it actually has multiple pages with each flick of the mouse).</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Defined Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/seb.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Neatly stacked rows and columns of content never goes out of style. Whether the grid is built with plenty of small pieces or just a four-by-four arrangement, a clean grid tells your user something about you from the start. This content is organized, managed well and ordered for you.</p>
            <p>Grids are incredibly popular among designers for their own portfolio websites. What’s nice about an image grid is that you can showcase a lot of visual content without looking junky. This gallery effect can be quite impactful.</p>
            <p>Grids can also come in the form of colored boxes or containers to organize text. Grid lines can be visible or invisible. There are so many options to choose from. Just remember to take particular care with the width and depth of columns and rows and spacing in between each. These little details can make or break the entire design.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The organization a grid creates is hard to beat. A nice grid makes it easy for users to find and interact with content while creating visual harmony.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use simple bits of animation for a tiled grid so that a hover of click “flips” a grid block to show additional information. Want another option? Consider turning the grid into a card deck, featuring a Material Design style.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. The Classic F-Pattern</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/motive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Research into the way people look at websites uncovered a particular flow known as the F-Pattern. The reading pattern showed that users start at the top of a website and read from left to right across the screen. Then they move down and read across again. Finally, they just skim to the bottom of the page in a straight line.</p>
            <p>Designing content in this F-Pattern is a way to help put the content that matters most right where users are looking. This concept translates into a common design outline.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header and navigation</li>
              <li>Wide left-hand column as the main content area</li>
              <li>Thin right-hand column (sidebar) for links and related information that doesn’t go to the bottom of the page</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> People are creatures of habit, and this is a tested pattern that shows the way people think, look at and read websites. It’s comfortable and common, making it easy for users to understand and interact with.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Flip the location of the sidebar or turn the sidebar into the navigation area, or use a hero image on top of the F-shaped pattern.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>5. Minimal Layering</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/berkeley.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Layering can draw the eye to exactly the location where it matters most in the design. Particularly in concert with a simple overall design, this is the element that begs users to take notice. Layering on a minimal outline is a great way to showcase or highlight a particular piece of content or call to action.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use subtle gradients or shadows to define elements in different layers. While these design techniques fell out of fashion for a while, creating barely-there differentiation is making a major comeback, thanks to Material Design and a refocusing on creating something tactile in the two-dimensional space.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>When in doubt with any type of design, the best thing you can go is go back to the roots of design theory. Use classic ideas and principles to guide your decision-making.</p>
            <p>In most cases, this will result in something that’s clean, easy to read and follows conventional style. Once you have that basic framework complete, then you can add a trendy element to keep the layout looking fresh. Using ones of this layout philosophy will help you create a website that will withstand the test of time better without looking dated. (Now that you are thinking about it, you’ll probably start to notice how many websites actually use one of these concepts.)</p>

            <h2>7 Tips for Creating a Memorable Design</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>It’s the goal of pretty much anyone with a website: to have users that come back again and again. They share your content; they engage with you regularly; they tell others about the website. They remember the website.</em>
            </p>
            <p>It doesn’t happen by accident. A memorable design is a tool that will help create this user connection. Here, we’re going to look at seven ways to create a lasting impression with seven stunning examples of how to do it. Learn how to create a design that sticks in the long term, and doesn’t fly under the radar!</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>1. Make an Impression</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/tosco.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Users will remember the first thing they do on your website, as well as the last thing they do. It’s important that the memory is a good one.</p>
            <p>Strong visuals on the landing page and a seamless finish to an action are key.</p>
            <p>Tosco Music does a great job making a first impression that starts with a combination of interesting visual effects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Left-hand navigation</li>
              <li>Strong contrast between elements</li>
              <li>Strong video content above the scroll</li>
              <li>Beautiful typography</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design also makes a good final impression as well. Users can find out more about a musical act they are interested in or are invited to sign up for the company’s email with a simple form that’s hard to miss. Each interaction is simple, seamless and gives the reason for users to come back to the site.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Tell a Story</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/walkwest.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>A website is your gateway to the world. It’s an opportunity to tell people who you are and why you matter. Whether the story is that of a brand or a travel blog, effective storytelling is the thread that keeps users hanging on.</p>
            <p>Telling that story is a two-part process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strong text to tell</li>
              <li>Interesting visuals to show</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’ll need both elements to put together a complete package.</p>
            <p>Walkwest starts by making a bold statement, and then they tell you a story to back it up. If you are in need of their services (public relations or marketing), this is something that’s likely to resonate with you. The way the story is told is simple with nice images and simple, short blocks of text.</p>
            <p>But not only does the website tell a story, the design leads you through it with interesting scroll patterns and visuals. The user becomes immersed in the interaction to learn more. And it all happens in a matter of seconds.</p>
            <p>That’s memorable storytelling.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Use Color Effectively</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/hillman.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Too much color and a design can cause users to abandon the site, too little color and the design can be forgotten. Right in the middle is an interesting mix of color that will stick with users.</p>
            <p>The trick to color is to create a palette that works for your content but also contrasts with a lot of the other things users come in contact with regularly. (Just think of how many websites you click on every day that have the same color blue for the background.)</p>
            <p>Hillman Living uses a stark image with little bits of intentional color to grab your attention and help users focus on the chairs in the image. (That’s what they are selling.)</p>
            <p>Move down the page and the aesthetic flips to a more traditional minimal style – with a white background – but each chair has the same color accents. This color use sticks with you. It’s hard to get the oranges and reds and blues out of your mind. (And they company is betting on the idea that you’ll think about them enough to buy.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. Do Something Fun</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/newcastle.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>What comes to mind when you think “fun website?” A game? A movie preview? What about design techniques such as color, imagery and typography?</p>
            <p>Any of these elements can make your design feel like fun.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Smiling faces in images or video</li>
              <li>Bright, saturated colors</li>
              <li>Something to do (a game)</li>
              <li>Light, playful language (particularly in a similar typeface)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Newcastle Now does many of these things. The site is for a region that’s trying to reinvent itself and everything about the design is fun and interesting, from the color palette to the funky shapes as design elements to happy people doing interesting things in all of the imagery. The design makes you feel like you want to jump into the scene and laugh with the characters on the screen. (Bet you would remember that!)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>5. Engage the Senses</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/ctimes.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It’s all about the writing and imagery when it comes to connecting with a users’ senses.</p>
            <p>One option is to interact with users and provide feedback. For example, a user inputs something into the website and something else is returned. (Think of it as a back and forth that happens in the same way as texting a friend.) Another option is to entice them into thinking about your design in the way that Coffee Times Coffee does.</p>
            <p>You probably won’t find a coffee drinker that doesn’t seem to smell the aroma when watching the video clips on the website homepage. (Some even claim to hear the beans in the grinder.) Either way, the design becomes more than just an image on the screen to the user, it invokes another pleasant memory through the senses. (One that is likely to linger for a while … or at least until another cup of coffee.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>6. Mix It Up</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/nikefleece.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Some websites are designed to have new content all the time, because they do connect with a repeat user base. (E-commerce is one common example, as are news or magazine-style websites.)</p>
            <p>Changing the content or tweaking the design can provide new an interesting experiences for users that encourage them to think about your site more often and return to it. The key is that the new experiences should still feel like your content and design (so this can be pretty tricky).</p>
            <p>Nike is one of the leaders in this area. The content on the homepage tends to be different with almost every visit, but each new homepage element is equally engaging. The other thing Nike does well is that every bit of content on the website homepage is tied to current events so that the things users are thinking about right now are exactly what they get from the worldwide sports gear retailer.</p>
            <p>While you probably don’t have the resources of Nike, it’s a great place to start in terms of information (and inspiration) gathering. Make a point to visit the homepage every week for the next month or so and look at the changes. How can you use those concepts to mix up your content?</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>7. Remember the Finish</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/startuplab.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>You’ve got a plan to delight designers with your homepage, the visual are stunning, there’s a great call to action, but don’t forget the finish. Just as important as the first impression is the final impression. Knowing how to design this can take a little more work because users might leave your website from a different location than where they enter (at least you hope they do).</p>
            <p>Dig through your analytics and find the page where most users are leaving and make that experience a good one. Create an offer to give users something – a good discount or printable/digital element – or lasting memory of the best part of your website.</p>
            <p>The key is that users leave happy. (It is equally important to ensure that they don’t leave because of an error of some sort.)</p>
            <p>Startup Lab includes a finishing action on the left side of every page – it’s a form that users are supposed to fil out. The finish is memorable because the action is easy to find, the form is easy to fill out and users accomplish a goal within two clicks of wherever they are on the site.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Memorable website design is one of those tricky areas because it almost happens to users subconsciously. Do you ever stop and say “I’m going to remember that website!”? It’s doubtful.</p>
            <p>But you do tend to remember some of the elements of what makes a website good. You think about the message later or get that afternoon craving for coffee.</p>
            <p>I’d love to see more examples of websites that have made a lasting impression on you.</p>

            <h1>&nbsp;Importance of Sitemaps</h1>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>There are many SEO tips and tricks that help in optimizing a site but one of those, the importance of which is sometimes underestimated is sitemaps. Sitemaps, as the name implies, are just a map of your site - i.e. on one single page you show the structure of your site, its sections, the links between them, etc. Sitemaps make navigating your site easier and having an updated sitemap on your site is good both for your users and for search engines. Sitemaps are an important way of communication with search engines. While in robots.txt you tell search engines which parts of your site to exclude from indexing, in your site map you tell search engines where you'd like them to go.</h4>
            <p>Sitemaps are not a novelty. They have always been part of best Web design practices but with the adoption of sitemaps by search engines, now they become even more important. However, it is necessary to make a clarification that if you are interested in sitemaps mainly from a SEO point of view, you can't go on with the conventional sitemap only (though currently Yahoo! and MSN still keep to the standard html format). For instance, Google Sitemaps uses a special (XML) format that is different from the ordinary html sitemap for human visitors.</p>
            <p>One might ask why two sitemaps are necessary. The answer is obvious - one is for humans, the other is for spiders (for now mainly Googlebot but it is reasonable to expect that other crawlers will join the club shortly). In that relation it is necessary to clarify that having two sitemaps is not regarded as duplicate content. In '<a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/about.html" target="_blank">Introduction to Sitemaps</a>', Google explicitly states that using a sitemap will never lead to penalty for your site.</p>
            <h3>Why Use a Sitemap</h3>
            <p>Using sitemaps has many benefits, not only easier navigation and better visibility by search engines. Sitemaps offer the opportunity to inform search engines immediately about any changes on your site. Of course, you cannot expect that search engines will rush right away to index your changed pages but certainly the changes will be indexed faster, compared to when you don't have a sitemap.</p>
            <p>Also, when you have a sitemap and submit it to the search engines, you rely less on external links that will bring search engines to your site. Sitemaps can even help with messy internal links - for instance if you by accident have broken internal links or orphaned pages that cannot be reached in other way (though there is no doubt that it is much better to fix your errors than rely on a sitemap).</p>
            <p>If your site is new, or if you have a significant number of new (or recently updated pages), then using a sitemap can be vital to your success. Although you can still go without a sitemap, it is likely that soon sitemaps will become the standard way of submitting a site to search engines. Though it is certain that spiders will continue to index the Web and sitemaps will not make the standard crawling procedures obsolete, it is logical to say that the importance of sitemaps will continue to increase.</p>
            <p>Sitemaps also help in classifying your site content, though search engines are by no means obliged to classify a page as belonging to a particular category or as matching a particular keyword only because you have told them so.</p>
            <p>Having in mind that the sitemap programs of major search engines (and especially Google) are still in beta, using a sitemap might not generate huge advantages right away but as search engines improve their sitemap indexing algorithms, it is expected that more and more sites will be indexed fast via sitemaps.</p>
            <h3>Generating and Submitting the Sitemap</h3>
            <p>The steps you need to perform in order to have a sitemap for your site are simple. First, you need to generate it, then you upload it to your site, and finally you notify Google about it.</p>
            <p>Depending on your technical skills, there are two ways to generate a sitemap - to download and install a sitemap generator or to use an online sitemap generation tool. The first is more difficult but you have more control over the output. You can download the Google sitemap generator from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137793&amp;package_id=153422">here</a>. After you download the package, follow the installation and configuration instructions in it. This generator is a Python script, so your Web server must have Python 2.2 or later installed, in order to run it.</p>
            <p>The second way to generate a sitemap is easier. There are many free online tools that can do the job for you. For instance, have a look at this collection of&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/sm_thirdparty.html" target="_blank">Third-party Sitemap tools</a>. Although Google says explicitly that it has neither tested, nor verified them, this list will be useful because it includes links to online generators, downloadable sitemap generators, sitemap plugins for popular content-management systems, etc., so you will be able to find exactly what you need.</p>
            <p>After you have created the sitemap, you need to upload it to your site (if it is not already there) and notify Google about its existence. Notifying Google includes&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login">adding the site to your Google Sitemaps account</a>, so if you do not have an account with Google, it is high time to open one. Another detail that is useful to know in advance is that in order to add the sitemap to your account, you need to verify that you are the legitimate owner of the site.</p>
            <p>Currently Yahoo! and MSN do not support sitemaps, or at least not in the XML format, used by Google.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request">Yahoo!</a>&nbsp;allows webmasters to submit “a text file with a list of URLs” (which can actually be a stripped-down version of a site map), while MSN does not offer even that but there are rumors that it is indexing sitemaps when they are available onsite. Most likely this situation will change in the near future and both Yahoo! and MSN will catch with Google because user-submitted site maps are just a too powerful SEO tool and cannot be ignored.</p>

            <p><strong>Should I use this</strong> plugin or <strong>that</strong> library? <strong>Should I plan</strong> this project or dive straight into coding? <strong>Should I ask</strong> for help or figure it out myself?</p>
            <p>Sounds familiar?</p>
            <p><strong>I know how you feel. I felt the same way.</strong> That all changed when I started implementing the below points into my routine.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a <strong>newbie</strong> or <strong>professional</strong>, chances are that some of these points will help you to <strong>bring your front-end development career to the next level</strong>.</p>
            <p>Here are 8 tips to <strong>help you to become a better front-end developer</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>1. Plan your projects</strong></h3>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>The first mistake and surprisingly <strong>very common</strong> even with senior developers is that <strong>most of us don’t plan</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s boring</strong>, we don’t know how to plan and <strong>we feel that it’s not our job</strong>.</p>
            <p>That’s why we quite often skip this <strong>very important step</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Good planning can help you to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>save you</strong> a lot of <strong>time</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>reduce stress</strong> when the deadline is approaching</li>
              <li>comfortably <strong>finish on time everyday</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And it <strong>doesn’t have to be complicated</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <blockquote><em>Simply putting down a list of templates and elements which need to be converted from PSD to HTML or breaking up any complex elements into a smaller parts and writing them down is enough.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Making a simple project based to-do list will allow you to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>stay organised</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>keep your head clear</strong> and focused on the task at hand</li>
              <li>highlight any roadblocks <strong>early</strong> in the project phase</li>
              <li><strong>easily</strong> keep your client, boss or project manager in the loop</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More on the last benefit in the point #2.</p>
            <p><strong>Helpful tools for planning</strong>

            <p>Planning is important, but <strong>not always everything goes as carefully planned</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>2. Be Proactive</strong></h3>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>There is nothing worse then telling your client or boss, that <strong>things are taking longer than expected</strong> and that the project <strong>won’t be delivered on time</strong>.</p>
            <p>Proactively highlighting any roadblocks or delays is a <strong>very powerful</strong> way to <strong>keep everyone happy</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s ok if things are taking longer</strong> than initially planned, but <strong>it’s not ok to keeping this for yourself</strong>.</p>
            <p>You’re stacked with a bug or can’t figure something out? <strong>You are not alone</strong>, everyone even the most experienced developers have <strong>the same issues on almost every project</strong>.</p>
            <p>When this happens, <strong>call it out</strong>!</p>
            <p>Everyone will appreciate that you are <strong>trying your best</strong> and <strong>keeping them in the loop</strong> with the progress.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <blockquote><em>Do you want to </em><strong><em>delight your client and boss</em></strong><em>? Send them a short summary of what you did today and what you will be working on tomorrow, highlighting any concerns.</em>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It should only <strong>take 5 minutes</strong>, and if you use tools from #1, <strong>even less time</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>They will love you</strong> for that because it <strong>gives them a time</strong> to think about a plan B, which might be simply asking the client for more money or <strong>extending the deadline</strong>.</p>
            <p>Other reasons why to be proactive:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>it makes you look <strong>more professional</strong>
              </li>
              <li>it <strong>boosts your credibility</strong>
              </li>
              <li>it <strong>helps to build a trust</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Setting a <strong>daily or weekly reminder</strong> will help you to never forget to give a project progress update.</p>
            <p><strong>Helpful tools for reminders</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar%E2%80%8E" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> – create a simple reoccurring event</li>
              <li><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> – create a note with a checklist of your tasks and set a reminder</li>
              <li><strong>iOS Reminders</strong> – doesn’t need a description, does it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Curious</strong> about the next point? <strong>Great</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>3. Be curious</strong></h3>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>I believe that one of <strong>the most important attributes</strong> on this list <strong>is being curious</strong>.</p>
            <p>New tools, plugins, techniques and languages are being released almost <strong>every day</strong>.</p>
            <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you stay <strong>open</strong> to all the new things and will <strong>make an effort</strong> to explore and understand them.</p>
            <p>The bad and at the same time the beauty of <strong>front-end development</strong> is that it’s moving forward <strong>very fast</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Be prepared</strong> to put up with late nights exploring other websites, experimenting with a new plugins and frameworks, reading web development blogs, listening to podcasts and chewing through thousands of tweets.</p>

            <p><strong>Clients and bosses are demanding</strong>, we all know that.</p>
            <p>But saying yes to everything can <strong>eventually turn against you</strong> and you will end up working for less, being under the pump and <strong>stressed out</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Carefully evaluate</strong> what are the project requirements and align that with <strong>your skills</strong>. Also be sure to ask which browsers you need to support.</p>
            <p>There is <strong>nothing wrong</strong> in highlighting which parts of the project will need a <strong>senior assistance</strong> or will need to be <strong>left out of the project scope</strong>.</p>

            <p>Contradictory to the previous point, but also important attribute of a <strong>highly effective front-end developer</strong> is learning <strong>something new on every project</strong>.</p>
            <p>Each project is a great way to implement a feature which you are not familiar with or you do <strong>something new for the first time</strong>.</p>
            <p>By <strong>saying no to everything</strong> and only doing the things you are familiar with, you are essentially <strong>closing the doors</strong> for <strong>personal and career development</strong>.</p>
            <p>You will soon drown in the sea of <strong>average developers</strong>.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, exploring the unknown will give you a <strong>great feeling of achievement, satisfaction</strong> and will keep you <strong>hungry to learn new things</strong> again and again.</p>
            <blockquote><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Pick a feature, plugin or a technique you wanted to use for some time and implement it in your next project.</em>

            <p>And if you need, <strong>use a mentor</strong> to steer you <strong>into the right direction</strong>.</p>

            <p>This could be your <strong>boss</strong>, your <strong>colleague</strong> or someone <strong>online</strong> who you will follow.</p>
            <p><strong>Bigger companies</strong> might have a formal <strong>mentorship program</strong> in place, but if you are in a small studio or on your own, <strong>look on the internet</strong>.</p>

            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>
