            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <p>Communicating via typefaces. Fonts and layout. Designing for readers. Legibility. Web Fonts: there’s life after Georgia and Verdana.

            <blockquote>“How do we deal with accessibility needs for which there are no definitive answers?”&nbsp;</blockquote>
            <p>asks Eleanor Ratliff. Sometimes we arrive at a fix that helps one group of people only to find that our solution undermines another group’s experience. Through the prism of typeface choice, Ratliff relates how she and her team tackled the problem of accessibility whack-a-mole for a rebranding project.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/spartan" target="_blank">Richard Fink</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;September 06, 2016</p>
            <p>Richard Fink first wrote about webfonts for A List Apart in 2010. Back then, those of us making the web were itching to break away from so-called “web-safe” fonts. And break away we did: by 2016, roughly 60 percent of sites were reportedly using webfonts, up from just two percent in 2011. Webfonts and, by extension, web typography, have blossomed. So surely no one would argue for a return to system fonts, right? Wrong. This article teases apart the arguments for and against.</p>

            <p>Type on the web has come a long way since the beginning of the decade. We now have literally thousands of fonts at our disposal to use on our sites. But the same faces—the Futuras, the Gothams, the Proxima Novas—crop up everywhere. Jeremiah Shoaf encourages us to break out of our cognitive ruts and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-rich-typefaces-get-richer" target="_blank">explore</a> the wealth of typographic diversity at our fingertips.</p>

            <p>The dog days are upon us—but instead of giving up in the summer swelter, take heart! We’ve got an extra-special reading list of bright, insightful brainfood. ALA’s third annual summer reader explores what’s been on the web industry’s mind lately, from accessibility to performance, from CSS techniques to web type, from mentorship to more collaborative approaches. It’s a list as cool and fancy as a watermelon-basil popsicle. Yeah, that does sound good, doesn’t it? Kick back, chill out, and get to reading.</p>

            <p>Displays that are more tiny than our lowest-size breakpoints require a more condensed range of type sizes. If you don’t already have in place a typographic system that can absorb the demands of this new context (watches, wearables, digital sticky notes, whatever), now might be the time to consider it. Matt Griffin was ready for anything because his <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/readable-wearables" target="_blank">site</a> was simple and built to be future friendly.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/Aetherpoint" target="_blank">Andrew Johnson</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;January 20, 2015</p>
            <p>We all want to design great typographic experiences—while serving users on a huge array of devices. But today’s type is inflexible and doesn’t scale. We can solve this problem by making webfonts more systemized and context-aware, and live web font interpolation—the modification of a font’s design in the browser—can help us get there. Andrew Johnson points the way.</p>

            <p>When you read, you filter text through your experiences and past conversations. You put words into context. You interpret. So how can we use typography to welcome readers and convince them to sit with us through this process? A List Apart alum Jason Santa Maria explains in this excerpt from Chapter 1 of On Web Typography, his new book from A Book Apart.</p>

            <p>A style guide, also referred to as a pattern library, is a living document that details the front-end code for all the elements and modules of a website or application. It also documents the site’s visual language, from header styles to color palettes. In short, a proper style guide is a one-stop guide that the entire team can reference when considering site changes and iterations. Susan Robertson shows us how to build and maintain a style guide that helps everyone from product owners and producers to designers and developers keep an ever-changing site on brand and on target.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/NickSherman" target="_blank">Nick Sherman</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;April 04, 2013</p>
            <p>For ideal <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/responsive-typography-is-a-physical-discipline" target="_blank">typography</a>, web designers need to know as much as possible about each user’s reading environment. That may seem obvious, but the act of specifying web typography is currently like ordering slices of pizza without knowing how large the slices are or what toppings they are covered with.</p>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Minimalism in design has been around for some time, and today it seems to be a welcome alternative to overly busy and unnecessarily cluttered websites, posters, ads, and logos. For those new to this art form, the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">minimalism</a>&nbsp;is mostly concerned with stripping away excess and strategically placing remaining elements. The result can be a calming, yet powerful design that is streamlined to convey its message. You can find minimalism in all art forms, from architecture to fashion to logo design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>To get the most out of a minimalist design, whether it be for something as small as a logo or large as a billboard, be sure to use the right elements correctly. Color, layout, white space, graphics &amp;&nbsp; typography all play an important role in minimalism. Below we look at these&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/06/13/how-to-design-learn-the-basics/" target="_blank">principles of design</a>&nbsp;and how they relate to minimalism.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalist Color Choices</strong></h3>
            <p>In minimalist design, color choice is strategic and the amount of colors used, should be kept to a minimum. Black, grey and white are the most powerful colors and allow for a single accent color to have a greater impact.</p>
            <p>All colors are acceptable if they are used properly; however, the colors with the greatest contrast are generally used together. Therefore, most designers choose bold and bright primary colours for minimalist design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Effective Minimalist Layout</strong></h3>
            <p>A minimalist design layout is especially challenging because every element with which you are working, is essential. Content for&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2011/03/01/web-design-tips-advice-from-a-to-z/" target="_blank">websites</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/05/13/how-to-design-a-movie-poster-with-an-example/" target="_blank">posters</a>&nbsp;should be laid out in such a way that the viewer can find what they need without much thought. In other words, the page should make sense.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/14_jan-reichle-website-500x232.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>White Space</strong></h3>
            <p>Negative space serves to give power to the small bits of information that it surrounds. The greater the empty space, the more power an object within it gains.&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/" target="_blank">Negative space</a>&nbsp;also serves to structure a group of elements and create balance.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p>The use of images in minimalism is very intentional. Designers choose graphics for their effectiveness and in minimalist design use them when the image is more effective than a written message. Graphics should be used sparingly and strategically, and should be relevant to the topic.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography in minimalism should be just as strategic as any other element. In any design including minimalism, no more than two or three styles of fonts are appropriate. Many designs use one font for headlines, one for body, and possibly one for navigation on websites or for any special text or subheadings. Usually more than three types makes the design look cluttered and hard to understand.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalism on the Web</strong></h3>
            <p>In the last ten years, minimalist website design has become quite trendy. Unfortunately, some designers have misunderstood the idea behind minimalism and create web pages void of content that simply don’t make sense. However, at the root of the minimalist movement, great designers have created stunning websites that are not only pleasing to look at, but are also easy to navigate. While minimalist design is not practical nor thematically possible for every every website, those websites that can use it should take advantage.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in the Media</h3>
            <p>Brochures, packaging, and ad campaigns have all seen their share of the minimalist design. However, it is in posters and logos that you see it really take hold. Many designers choose to use this streamlined design for everything from movie posters, to band posters, to ad posters. The reason for this is the effectiveness of conveying a strong message quickly and cleanly. Used correctly, minimalist posters are designed to use each of its elements to send one message. The result is usually a poster that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in logos</h3>
            <p>Minimalism in&nbsp;<a href="http://logooftheday.com/" target="_blank">logos</a>&nbsp;is an important concept, since the purpose of a logo is to be easily remembered and associated with a company. As a result, minimalist logos are often the most popular type of logo design since it keeps the logo simple enough to be memorable. The tricky part of a minimalist logo is to make a design that is easily recognised for the company it represents, while also reflecting the brand’s goals.</p>

            <h2>How to Create a Timeless Design: 7 Tips</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>The best designs never really go out of style. These classics are often rooted deep in design theory and have that certain something that helps them withstand the test of time. You know some of them – brands such as Nike and Coca-Cola have logos, colors and overall design personalities that have stood for decades.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Thankfully, that timeless concept is something you can apply to almost any project. You might not have the same visual recognition as the Swoosh, but you can create an aesthetic that can work for you for years to come. Here’s how to do it.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>1. Focus on Readable Content</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/rainn.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It starts with readable type, images and overall clarity in the design and message. While that sounds like a tall order, a focus on simplicity and readability are key.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typography needs to be readable at any size and without difficulty. Novelty typefaces can be fun for a while, but if users don’t know what you are trying to say, the design will fall short.</li>
              <li>Images should be sharp, of high quality and easy to understand. Just as typography needs to be readable, all other visuals must be read as well. Can the user understand what is happening in the image and how it relates to what you are trying to say?</li>
              <li>The design needs to look good, but should provide a clear message or meaning. Images, text and user actions should create an integrated experience that users understand and want to be a part of. If the parts are asynchronous and disjointed, even a beautiful design can fail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Incorporate Interactivity</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/bangui.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Once you put all the visual elements together, users should want to interact with it. This doesn’t mean you have to create a virtual reality experience – although you could. Even small touches of interaction can make a design feel more realistic and add to the personality of the project.</p>
            <p>When thinking about interactive elements, design for usability and usefulness. Interactivity should do something that can’t be done in another way. It might be how you tell a story, a thoughtful navigation pattern or a bit of movement or action just to delight users.</p>
            <p>Set a goal for the interactive visual, keep it simple and smooth and make sure it works with your content plan for maximum impact.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>3. Create a Visual Scale</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/wekiwi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Every website needs a hierarchy of elements. Big items, regular-sized elements and small pieces. Each of these elements needs a place in the design with plenty of space to differentiate it from other parts of the visual display.</p>
            <p>A good visual scale provides a way to proportionately design and place elements – from type to space to size – so that everything seems to fit in a logical manner.</p>
            <p>A good scale creates flow in a pattern that’s easy for the user to recognize and work with. (There’s a reason that most website have a left-top logo, large image and then body text. It provides a visual scale that shows users how to read the content.)</p>
            <p>Just as important as the scale and weight of items are the consistency in use. If a button is one color and size on the homepage, it should have the same design on other pages. Body text, headlines and color choices should follow rules of consistency across pages as well.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. Accent Elements with Purpose</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/felt.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>The most lasting designs have a little something extra to set them off from everything else. Accent elements with a purpose, use color in interesting ways and include touches of flair that are a little more modern and keep the design from feeling stark.</p>
            <p>Accents include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Special bits of typography</li>
              <li>Interesting pops of color</li>
              <li>Simple animations</li>
              <li>An unusual texture of background</li>
              <li>Almost anything unexpected</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of accents as little surprises that help direct users through the design. They should provide direction and informational understanding about the content as well as provide visual interest.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>5. Establish Identity</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/penguins.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Every part of your visual identity should look like your brand. This applies to everything from your website to business cards to photo and logos on social media. Users should know who you are just by looking and not have to wonder if they wandered into content by mistake.</p>
            <p>This brand identity is important – vital, actually. Creating a brand identity is a giant undertaking and if you don’t have one already, it should be on your radar. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help create visual identity and consistency.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the same colors.</li>
              <li>Stick to a handful of fonts and sizes.</li>
              <li>Consider alignment rules for text and pick a style.</li>
              <li>Establish a photo style – color vs. black and white vs. another technique.</li>
              <li>Stick to the same voice for messaging – formal vs. casual.</li>
              <li>Be yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>6. Forget the Gimmicks</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/babygi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Designs that are too trendy can fade out of fashion fast. They can also date the design so it looks like it came from a certain time period. That’s not to discourage the use of trends, though; just use them smartly.</p>
            <p>Timeless design patterns are rooted in design theory. Basic principles and guidelines shape how the visual outline comes together. Consider that in relationship to trends. How well do they mesh? One of the reasons Material Design concepts – a big trend – seems to work so well is that it is rooted in physical ideals and motion. It takes a two-dimensional idea and pushes it forward.</p>
            <p>Using a specific typeface, complicated plugin or animation or color palette are visual ideas that you should think about. How long will the look fresh and relevant? Or do you have a plan to switch these elements out while keeping the rest of the design? You can be trendy and timeless!</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>7. Use a Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/aussie-ballet.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Proper organization never goes out of style. From a simple grid to a grid-based visual display, a strong grill provides the foundation for a solid design.</p>
            <p>When thinking about and planning a grid, think vertically and horizontally. Often designers spend a lot of time on the columnar spacing and vertical issues lurk in the design. A good grid provides enough flexibility to create and place elements with ease in a way that create harmony and flow. It also provides a guideline for spacing (including white space) and alignment of elements and parts.</p>
            <p>The grid can influence every visual aspect of the design from the size of photos and type to how icons or buttons line up with other content. The grid can be as complicated or simple as the project dictates, but should be enforced with every design element to maintain visual consistency.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Timeless design isn’t about specific techniques; it is about making design choices that are balanced, logical and easy for users to comprehend. While trendy elements can be a lot of fun, more timeless projects use a mix of classic and modern elements to share information in a directed way.</p>
            <p>When you want to create something that will last a long time, the best idea is to go back to the basics. Almost all lasting design concepts are rooted in theories that have been used for a long time.</p>

            <h2>How Does a User See Design?</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s often a disconnect between the way a designer looks at a website or brochure or package and the way users see it. As a designer, you can appreciate trends and attention to typography and details in a way that the common user might not.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Users only know whether they understand something when they interact with it. The details of how that interaction happens or why it is pleasing are often lost. It’s a pretty harsh reality.
            </p>
            <p>But there’s a nugget of wisdom in understanding that disconnect. If you think about what users are thinking, you will be a better designer. (Even if you don’t particularly like their thoughts on design.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography is Good or Bad</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/prototyze-the-year-of-the-incubator.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Designers love typography. Beautiful characters. Long swashes. Serifs with charm.</p>
            <p>Sadly, many users don’t know Arial from Helvetica. (Nor do they care.) When it comes to type, users know one thing. Can they read it?</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean you can forget lettering in projects. It actually means quite the opposite. You need to pay even more attention to it. To keep users interested, every word, paragraph and headline must be perfectly readable. Users should not have to concentrate or think about the words to decipher them.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to ensure that words are clear, spacing is adjusted properly and every bit of the message is on clear display.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Color Often Goes Unnoticed</h3>

            <p>Users don’t pay as much attention to color as you might expect. While designers may ponder over the difference between periwinkle and coneflower for hours, the casual user will often see blue.</p>
            <p>Now here’s the caveat: If a color changes dramatically, say from blue to yellow, users will notice. When it comes to color, big shifts in hue are what users tend to focus on.</p>
            <p>The thing that’s difficult about color is perception. People bring so many different notions and ideas to color choices. Make sure you have a general idea of common color associations and pair color in a way that’s accessible to all – consider choices that are visible for those that don’t see color well – for the safest color combinations.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Buttons Need to Be Obvious</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/alex-kot.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>There was an almost fatal flaw in ghost button trend: Users did not see the button when interacting with the design. It almost seemed to fade into the background.</p>
            <p>While this has shifted somewhat over time, and as ghost buttons became more popular, it was a real problem (and still can be in some instances). Super-trendy elements that look different from what users expect can lead to lost conversions.</p>
            <p>Calls to action – forms, buttons, links – need to obvious and follow common user patterns for the most success. Users have short attention spans and won’t stick around to “learn” an unconventional design. Make it easy for them.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism is ‘Overrated’</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/simone-viola-design-studio.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Admit it. Minimalism is one of your favorite go-to design options.</p>
            <p>While some users appreciate this simple beauty, more often it feels stark to them. “Where is everything?” they might ask.</p>
            <p>This can be a difficult hurdle to overcome. You’re likely to see this pushback in the early stages of design when working with clients that are always asking to put more “stuff” in the design – more photos, more color, more text.</p>
            <p>Try to strike a balance with nice open spaces and clean lines that don’t feel cluttered. The end result might not be purely minimal, but will be more pleasing to the client and end user.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Big Images Take Up a Lot of Space</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/brave.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>A large, interesting image will grab a user’s attention like few other things. But users don’t always agree with this statement.</p>
            <p>This is one of those situations where the user doesn’t know what they don’t know. It’s hard to compare a design with small images versus oversized options. The difference in impact is often clear for someone with that design eye.</p>
            <p>This is where you have to sell it to clients in the best interest of users. Go back to the theory that magazines and newspapers have used for years – tell users what is important. A big photo or video or illustration does that. A group of small elements often does not have the same lasting impression.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to help figure out what that first impression is supposed to be with the design. What problem are you trying to solve? What does the user need to know right away? Therein lies the answer.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>They Know Branding</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/etecc-interactive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Everyday users know a lot more about branding than they are given credit for. A user will know of a brand changes color or if the font in the logo shifts. (They might not always be able to pinpoint what’s different, but will know something has changed.)</p>
            <p>Any shift in an established brand identity can be jarring and confusing to users. That’s why it is so important to follow established rules for how to represent a brand visually. (If you are not working for a style guide, it is time to develop one now.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>It Either Works or Doesn’t</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/percept-brand-design.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Have you started to pick up on a common theme in what users perceive when they look at a design?</p>
            <p>It either works … or it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>Users seldom understand why. Users seldom care why a design works or not. If it works, they continue to engage. When it doesn’t, they abandon the design and move on to something else.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to be ahead of the user when it comes to what works or doesn’t. A good plan for user testing helps. More important are all of those design basics that you probably don’t think about. Design and color theory, user patterns, principles of typography and even speed and interaction design with websites and apps.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>It’s a lot to think about. You only thought you had to design something that looks good to you, right?</p>
            <p>The good thing that is that most clients often see the design like typical users. Many of these issues are at the root of conversations you are already having. Hopefully, now you can think about them a little differently and plan for what these users are thinking (and how to help improve the design so that it looks great to you … and them!)</p>

            <h2>5 Website Layout Ideas That Never Get Old</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s always that moment at the beginning of a website design project where you think “where do I start?” You’ll battle the desire to create something totally different and new versus something tested and reliable.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Realistically, there are a few layouts that just never get old. These patterns are generally accepted by users, easy to understand and provide a solid framework for pretty much any design and content type. Here, we’ll look at these five “timeless” website layouts and how to make the most of them for your next project.</p>
            <h3>1. Hero Image Stacked on Simple Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/armando.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>No matter the screen size, this format gives the user something to look at, scroll through and digest. While the actual specifications for this shape might changes based on device type or whether you prefer a full-width or shallow image, the sketch is roughly the same.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Hero image with text overlay</li>
              <li>2 to 4 columns with small information elements with or without icons</li>
              <li>Main body area</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design is clean, provides a strong visual presence and tends to work well with responsive frameworks regardless of breakpoint. Some alternative applications of this format are to switch a static hero header for a slider or video header.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/rodesk.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Every element has a place and there is a logical flow to following the content. The main image is the first impression that should draw users into the design and secondary elements should make users want to click around.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add bright colored icons or boxes to the column-based informational elements, or use a flat style for the user interface elements throughout the design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. One Page, One Column</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/pop-up.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>One page layouts are one of the best solutions for websites with minimal content and a single focus or message. When the message is simple, there’s not need to go crazy with the shape of the layout either. A one-column layout can be the perfect solution.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Main body area with images and text</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using this design pattern, space is a vital design element. Ensure that elements have plenty of room between them and consider using exaggerated spacing on the outside edges of the design. The risk with a one-page website is that it can feel cramped or disorganized if spacing is out of whack.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The one-page formula is best-suited for small websites. It can make the lack of content on an introductory page or simple portfolio feel weightier than it is. The format also works well for simple blogs or content plans that stick to a single format.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add parallax scrolling to make the page feel more engaging as users scroll. These simple effects can make a simple one-page design feel deeper and more robust (and like it actually has multiple pages with each flick of the mouse).</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Defined Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/seb.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Neatly stacked rows and columns of content never goes out of style. Whether the grid is built with plenty of small pieces or just a four-by-four arrangement, a clean grid tells your user something about you from the start. This content is organized, managed well and ordered for you.</p>
            <p>Grids are incredibly popular among designers for their own portfolio websites. What’s nice about an image grid is that you can showcase a lot of visual content without looking junky. This gallery effect can be quite impactful.</p>
            <p>Grids can also come in the form of colored boxes or containers to organize text. Grid lines can be visible or invisible. There are so many options to choose from. Just remember to take particular care with the width and depth of columns and rows and spacing in between each. These little details can make or break the entire design.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The organization a grid creates is hard to beat. A nice grid makes it easy for users to find and interact with content while creating visual harmony.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use simple bits of animation for a tiled grid so that a hover of click “flips” a grid block to show additional information. Want another option? Consider turning the grid into a card deck, featuring a Material Design style.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. The Classic F-Pattern</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/motive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Research into the way people look at websites uncovered a particular flow known as the F-Pattern. The reading pattern showed that users start at the top of a website and read from left to right across the screen. Then they move down and read across again. Finally, they just skim to the bottom of the page in a straight line.</p>
            <p>Designing content in this F-Pattern is a way to help put the content that matters most right where users are looking. This concept translates into a common design outline.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header and navigation</li>
              <li>Wide left-hand column as the main content area</li>
              <li>Thin right-hand column (sidebar) for links and related information that doesn’t go to the bottom of the page</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> People are creatures of habit, and this is a tested pattern that shows the way people think, look at and read websites. It’s comfortable and common, making it easy for users to understand and interact with.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Flip the location of the sidebar or turn the sidebar into the navigation area, or use a hero image on top of the F-shaped pattern.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>5. Minimal Layering</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/berkeley.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Layering can draw the eye to exactly the location where it matters most in the design. Particularly in concert with a simple overall design, this is the element that begs users to take notice. Layering on a minimal outline is a great way to showcase or highlight a particular piece of content or call to action.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use subtle gradients or shadows to define elements in different layers. While these design techniques fell out of fashion for a while, creating barely-there differentiation is making a major comeback, thanks to Material Design and a refocusing on creating something tactile in the two-dimensional space.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>When in doubt with any type of design, the best thing you can go is go back to the roots of design theory. Use classic ideas and principles to guide your decision-making.</p>
            <p>In most cases, this will result in something that’s clean, easy to read and follows conventional style. Once you have that basic framework complete, then you can add a trendy element to keep the layout looking fresh. Using ones of this layout philosophy will help you create a website that will withstand the test of time better without looking dated. (Now that you are thinking about it, you’ll probably start to notice how many websites actually use one of these concepts.)</p>

            <h2>7 Tips for Creating a Memorable Design</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>It’s the goal of pretty much anyone with a website: to have users that come back again and again. They share your content; they engage with you regularly; they tell others about the website. They remember the website.</em>
            </p>
            <p>It doesn’t happen by accident. A memorable design is a tool that will help create this user connection. Here, we’re going to look at seven ways to create a lasting impression with seven stunning examples of how to do it. Learn how to create a design that sticks in the long term, and doesn’t fly under the radar!</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>1. Make an Impression</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/tosco.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Users will remember the first thing they do on your website, as well as the last thing they do. It’s important that the memory is a good one.</p>
            <p>Strong visuals on the landing page and a seamless finish to an action are key.</p>
            <p>Tosco Music does a great job making a first impression that starts with a combination of interesting visual effects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Left-hand navigation</li>
              <li>Strong contrast between elements</li>
              <li>Strong video content above the scroll</li>
              <li>Beautiful typography</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design also makes a good final impression as well. Users can find out more about a musical act they are interested in or are invited to sign up for the company’s email with a simple form that’s hard to miss. Each interaction is simple, seamless and gives the reason for users to come back to the site.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Tell a Story</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/walkwest.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>A website is your gateway to the world. It’s an opportunity to tell people who you are and why you matter. Whether the story is that of a brand or a travel blog, effective storytelling is the thread that keeps users hanging on.</p>
            <p>Telling that story is a two-part process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strong text to tell</li>
              <li>Interesting visuals to show</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’ll need both elements to put together a complete package.</p>
            <p>Walkwest starts by making a bold statement, and then they tell you a story to back it up. If you are in need of their services (public relations or marketing), this is something that’s likely to resonate with you. The way the story is told is simple with nice images and simple, short blocks of text.</p>
            <p>But not only does the website tell a story, the design leads you through it with interesting scroll patterns and visuals. The user becomes immersed in the interaction to learn more. And it all happens in a matter of seconds.</p>
            <p>That’s memorable storytelling.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Use Color Effectively</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/hillman.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Too much color and a design can cause users to abandon the site, too little color and the design can be forgotten. Right in the middle is an interesting mix of color that will stick with users.</p>
            <p>The trick to color is to create a palette that works for your content but also contrasts with a lot of the other things users come in contact with regularly. (Just think of how many websites you click on every day that have the same color blue for the background.)</p>
            <p>Hillman Living uses a stark image with little bits of intentional color to grab your attention and help users focus on the chairs in the image. (That’s what they are selling.)</p>
            <p>Move down the page and the aesthetic flips to a more traditional minimal style – with a white background – but each chair has the same color accents. This color use sticks with you. It’s hard to get the oranges and reds and blues out of your mind. (And they company is betting on the idea that you’ll think about them enough to buy.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. Do Something Fun</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/newcastle.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>What comes to mind when you think “fun website?” A game? A movie preview? What about design techniques such as color, imagery and typography?</p>
            <p>Any of these elements can make your design feel like fun.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Smiling faces in images or video</li>
              <li>Bright, saturated colors</li>
              <li>Something to do (a game)</li>
              <li>Light, playful language (particularly in a similar typeface)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Newcastle Now does many of these things. The site is for a region that’s trying to reinvent itself and everything about the design is fun and interesting, from the color palette to the funky shapes as design elements to happy people doing interesting things in all of the imagery. The design makes you feel like you want to jump into the scene and laugh with the characters on the screen. (Bet you would remember that!)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>5. Engage the Senses</h3>

            <p>It’s all about the writing and imagery when it comes to connecting with a users’ senses.</p>
            <p>One option is to interact with users and provide feedback. For example, a user inputs something into the website and something else is returned. (Think of it as a back and forth that happens in the same way as texting a friend.) Another option is to entice them into thinking about your design in the way that Coffee Times Coffee does.</p>
            <p>You probably won’t find a coffee drinker that doesn’t seem to smell the aroma when watching the video clips on the website homepage. (Some even claim to hear the beans in the grinder.) Either way, the design becomes more than just an image on the screen to the user, it invokes another pleasant memory through the senses. (One that is likely to linger for a while … or at least until another cup of coffee.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>6. Mix It Up</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/nikefleece.jpg">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Some websites are designed to have new content all the time, because they do connect with a repeat user base. (E-commerce is one common example, as are news or magazine-style websites.)</p>
            <p>Changing the content or tweaking the design can provide new an interesting experiences for users that encourage them to think about your site more often and return to it. The key is that the new experiences should still feel like your content and design (so this can be pretty tricky).</p>
            <p>Nike is one of the leaders in this area. The content on the homepage tends to be different with almost every visit, but each new homepage element is equally engaging. The other thing Nike does well is that every bit of content on the website homepage is tied to current events so that the things users are thinking about right now are exactly what they get from the worldwide sports gear retailer.</p>
            <p>While you probably don’t have the resources of Nike, it’s a great place to start in terms of information (and inspiration) gathering. Make a point to visit the homepage every week for the next month or so and look at the changes. How can you use those concepts to mix up your content?</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>7. Remember the Finish</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/startuplab.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>You’ve got a plan to delight designers with your homepage, the visual are stunning, there’s a great call to action, but don’t forget the finish. Just as important as the first impression is the final impression. Knowing how to design this can take a little more work because users might leave your website from a different location than where they enter (at least you hope they do).</p>
            <p>Dig through your analytics and find the page where most users are leaving and make that experience a good one. Create an offer to give users something – a good discount or printable/digital element – or lasting memory of the best part of your website.</p>
            <p>The key is that users leave happy. (It is equally important to ensure that they don’t leave because of an error of some sort.)</p>
            <p>Startup Lab includes a finishing action on the left side of every page – it’s a form that users are supposed to fil out. The finish is memorable because the action is easy to find, the form is easy to fill out and users accomplish a goal within two clicks of wherever they are on the site.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Memorable website design is one of those tricky areas because it almost happens to users subconsciously. Do you ever stop and say “I’m going to remember that website!”? It’s doubtful.</p>
            <p>But you do tend to remember some of the elements of what makes a website good. You think about the message later or get that afternoon craving for coffee.</p>
            <p>I’d love to see more examples of websites that have made a lasting impression on you.</p>

            <h1>&nbsp;Importance of Sitemaps</h1>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>There are many SEO tips and tricks that help in optimizing a site but one of those, the importance of which is sometimes underestimated is sitemaps. Sitemaps, as the name implies, are just a map of your site - i.e. on one single page you show the structure of your site, its sections, the links between them, etc. Sitemaps make navigating your site easier and having an updated sitemap on your site is good both for your users and for search engines. Sitemaps are an important way of communication with search engines. While in robots.txt you tell search engines which parts of your site to exclude from indexing, in your site map you tell search engines where you'd like them to go.</h4>
            <p>Sitemaps are not a novelty. They have always been part of best Web design practices but with the adoption of sitemaps by search engines, now they become even more important. However, it is necessary to make a clarification that if you are interested in sitemaps mainly from a SEO point of view, you can't go on with the conventional sitemap only (though currently Yahoo! and MSN still keep to the standard html format). For instance, Google Sitemaps uses a special (XML) format that is different from the ordinary html sitemap for human visitors.</p>
            <p>One might ask why two sitemaps are necessary. The answer is obvious - one is for humans, the other is for spiders (for now mainly Googlebot but it is reasonable to expect that other crawlers will join the club shortly). In that relation it is necessary to clarify that having two sitemaps is not regarded as duplicate content. In '<a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/about.html" target="_blank">Introduction to Sitemaps</a>', Google explicitly states that using a sitemap will never lead to penalty for your site.</p>
            <h3>Why Use a Sitemap</h3>
            <p>Using sitemaps has many benefits, not only easier navigation and better visibility by search engines. Sitemaps offer the opportunity to inform search engines immediately about any changes on your site. Of course, you cannot expect that search engines will rush right away to index your changed pages but certainly the changes will be indexed faster, compared to when you don't have a sitemap.</p>
            <p>Also, when you have a sitemap and submit it to the search engines, you rely less on external links that will bring search engines to your site. Sitemaps can even help with messy internal links - for instance if you by accident have broken internal links or orphaned pages that cannot be reached in other way (though there is no doubt that it is much better to fix your errors than rely on a sitemap).</p>
            <p>If your site is new, or if you have a significant number of new (or recently updated pages), then using a sitemap can be vital to your success. Although you can still go without a sitemap, it is likely that soon sitemaps will become the standard way of submitting a site to search engines. Though it is certain that spiders will continue to index the Web and sitemaps will not make the standard crawling procedures obsolete, it is logical to say that the importance of sitemaps will continue to increase.</p>
            <p>Sitemaps also help in classifying your site content, though search engines are by no means obliged to classify a page as belonging to a particular category or as matching a particular keyword only because you have told them so.</p>
            <p>Having in mind that the sitemap programs of major search engines (and especially Google) are still in beta, using a sitemap might not generate huge advantages right away but as search engines improve their sitemap indexing algorithms, it is expected that more and more sites will be indexed fast via sitemaps.</p>
            <h3>Generating and Submitting the Sitemap</h3>
            <p>The steps you need to perform in order to have a sitemap for your site are simple. First, you need to generate it, then you upload it to your site, and finally you notify Google about it.</p>
            <p>Depending on your technical skills, there are two ways to generate a sitemap - to download and install a sitemap generator or to use an online sitemap generation tool. The first is more difficult but you have more control over the output. You can download the Google sitemap generator from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137793&package_id=153422">here</a>. After you download the package, follow the installation and configuration instructions in it. This generator is a Python script, so your Web server must have Python 2.2 or later installed, in order to run it.</p>
            <p>The second way to generate a sitemap is easier. There are many free online tools that can do the job for you. For instance, have a look at this collection of&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/sm_thirdparty.html" target="_blank">Third-party Sitemap tools</a>. Although Google says explicitly that it has neither tested, nor verified them, this list will be useful because it includes links to online generators, downloadable sitemap generators, sitemap plugins for popular content-management systems, etc., so you will be able to find exactly what you need.</p>
            <p>After you have created the sitemap, you need to upload it to your site (if it is not already there) and notify Google about its existence. Notifying Google includes&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/login">adding the site to your Google Sitemaps account</a>, so if you do not have an account with Google, it is high time to open one. Another detail that is useful to know in advance is that in order to add the sitemap to your account, you need to verify that you are the legitimate owner of the site.</p>
            <p>Currently Yahoo! and MSN do not support sitemaps, or at least not in the XML format, used by Google.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://submit.search.yahoo.com/free/request">Yahoo!</a>&nbsp;allows webmasters to submit “a text file with a list of URLs” (which can actually be a stripped-down version of a site map), while MSN does not offer even that but there are rumors that it is indexing sitemaps when they are available onsite. Most likely this situation will change in the near future and both Yahoo! and MSN will catch with Google because user-submitted site maps are just a too powerful SEO tool and cannot be ignored.</p>

            <p><strong>Should I use this</strong> plugin or <strong>that</strong> library? <strong>Should I plan</strong> this project or dive straight into coding? <strong>Should I ask</strong> for help or figure it out myself?</p>
            <p>Sounds familiar?</p>
            <p><strong>I know how you feel. I felt the same way.</strong> That all changed when I started implementing the below points into my routine.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a <strong>newbie</strong> or <strong>professional</strong>, chances are that some of these points will help you to <strong>bring your front-end development career to the next level</strong>.</p>
            <p>Here are 8 tips to <strong>help you to become a better front-end developer</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>1. Plan your projects</strong></h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth">
              <div><img src="images/img_planning-tools.png">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>The first mistake and surprisingly <strong>very common</strong> even with senior developers is that <strong>most of us don’t plan</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s boring</strong>, we don’t know how to plan and <strong>we feel that it’s not our job</strong>.</p>
            <p>That’s why we quite often skip this <strong>very important step</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Good planning can help you to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>save you</strong> a lot of <strong>time</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>reduce stress</strong> when the deadline is approaching</li>
              <li>comfortably <strong>finish on time everyday</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>And it <strong>doesn’t have to be complicated</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <blockquote><em>Simply putting down a list of templates and elements which need to be converted from PSD to HTML or breaking up any complex elements into a smaller parts and writing them down is enough.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Making a simple project based to-do list will allow you to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>stay organised</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>keep your head clear</strong> and focused on the task at hand</li>
              <li>highlight any roadblocks <strong>early</strong> in the project phase</li>
              <li><strong>easily</strong> keep your client, boss or project manager in the loop</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More on the last benefit in the point #2.</p>
            <p><strong>Helpful tools for planning</strong>

            </ul>
            <p>Planning is important, but <strong>not always everything goes as carefully planned</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>2. Be Proactive</strong></h3>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>There is nothing worse then telling your client or boss, that <strong>things are taking longer than expected</strong> and that the project <strong>won’t be delivered on time</strong>.</p>
            <p>Proactively highlighting any roadblocks or delays is a <strong>very powerful</strong> way to <strong>keep everyone happy</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s ok if things are taking longer</strong> than initially planned, but <strong>it’s not ok to keeping this for yourself</strong>.</p>
            <p>You’re stacked with a bug or can’t figure something out? <strong>You are not alone</strong>, everyone even the most experienced developers have <strong>the same issues on almost every project</strong>.</p>
            <p>When this happens, <strong>call it out</strong>!</p>
            <p>Everyone will appreciate that you are <strong>trying your best</strong> and <strong>keeping them in the loop</strong> with the progress.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <blockquote><em>Do you want to </em><strong><em>delight your client and boss</em></strong><em>? Send them a short summary of what you did today and what you will be working on tomorrow, highlighting any concerns.</em>

              </li>
              <li>it <strong>helps to build a trust</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Setting a <strong>daily or weekly reminder</strong> will help you to never forget to give a project progress update.</p>

            <p><strong>Curious</strong> about the next point? <strong>Great</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            <p>I believe that one of <strong>the most important attributes</strong> on this list <strong>is being curious</strong>.</p>
            <p>New tools, plugins, techniques and languages are being released almost <strong>every day</strong>.</p>
            <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you stay <strong>open</strong> to all the new things and will <strong>make an effort</strong> to explore and understand them.</p>
            <p>The bad and at the same time the beauty of <strong>front-end development</strong> is that it’s moving forward <strong>very fast</strong>.</p>
            <p>This means that you can <strong>quickly become an expert</strong> but also your skills can <strong>become very quickly outdated</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Clients and bosses are demanding</strong>, we all know that.</p>
            <p>But saying yes to everything can <strong>eventually turn against you</strong> and you will end up working for less, being under the pump and <strong>stressed out</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Carefully evaluate</strong> what are the project requirements and align that with <strong>your skills</strong>. Also be sure to ask which browsers you need to support.</p>
            <p>There is <strong>nothing wrong</strong> in highlighting which parts of the project will need a <strong>senior assistance</strong> or will need to be <strong>left out of the project scope</strong>.</p>
            <p>Highlighting these <strong>earlier in the project timeline</strong> will make the whole process from start to finish <strong>much smoother</strong> for everyone.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <blockquote><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Don’t be afraid to call out functionality or feature which is out of your skill set. Being honest is the key, but also make sure you don’t say no to everything.</em>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Contradictory to the previous point, but also important attribute of a <strong>highly effective front-end developer</strong> is learning <strong>something new on every project</strong>.</p>
            <p>Each project is a great way to implement a feature which you are not familiar with or you do <strong>something new for the first time</strong>.</p>
            <p>By <strong>saying no to everything</strong> and only doing the things you are familiar with, you are essentially <strong>closing the doors</strong> for <strong>personal and career development</strong>.</p>
            <p>You will soon drown in the sea of <strong>average developers</strong>.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, exploring the unknown will give you a <strong>great feeling of achievement, satisfaction</strong> and will keep you <strong>hungry to learn new things</strong> again and again.</p>
            <blockquote><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Pick a feature, plugin or a technique you wanted to use for some time and implement it in your next project.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And if you need, <strong>use a mentor</strong> to steer you <strong>into the right direction</strong>.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>7. Find a mentor</strong></h3>
            <p>‍</p>

            <p>You are keen to learn, but <strong>not sure where to start</strong>? What should you <strong>learn next</strong>? How to implement this or that?</p>
            <p><strong>That’s what mentors are great for.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Find someone with more experience than you, someone who is keen to <strong>help you to grow</strong>.</p>
            <p>Your mentor should be someone <strong>who you respect</strong>, someone who you would like to <strong>be like</strong>. Someone who can teach you how to code and <strong>what to avoid doing</strong>.</p>
            <p>This could be your <strong>boss</strong>, your <strong>colleague</strong> or someone <strong>online</strong> who you will follow.</p>
            <p><strong>Bigger companies</strong> might have a formal <strong>mentorship program</strong> in place, but if you are in a small studio or on your own, <strong>look on the internet</strong>.</p>
            <p>Following developers like a <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/about/" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/about/" target="_blank">Paul Irish</a> or getting a mentor through <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> or <strong>similar programs might be a good idea</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote><strong><em>TIP</em></strong><em>: If you are not going forward, you are going backwards, especially in web development.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>A good mentor will help you:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>to <strong>get advice</strong> on your project approach</li>
              <li>to <strong>get a sense of direction</strong>
              </li>
              <li>to help you foresee any <strong>potential roadblocks</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Remember a mentor </em><strong><em>is not</em></strong><em> a guy who will do everything instead of you and </em><strong><em>is not there to motivate you</em></strong><em>. You still need to </em><strong><em>be curious and self-motivated</em></strong><em> in order to grow.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Still with me? <strong>Great</strong>..thanks, but don’t forget to move.</p>

            <p>Working in the digital industry means that we spend a <strong>lot of time</strong> staring at the computer screen.</p>
            <p><strong>Sitting 40-60 hours</strong> in the office will sooner or later take it’s toll.</p>
            <p>That’s why it’s <strong>vitally important</strong> that you <strong>look after your body</strong> the same way as you take care of keeping your markup nicely organised and commenting everything you do.</p>
            <p><strong>Healthy body and healthy mind means a better code</strong>. So when you schedule your week, don’t forget to include some <strong>non digital activities</strong> – walk, run, gym or whatever else will make you forget about all the pixels around you.</p>
            <blockquote><strong><em>Tip</em></strong><em>: Watching YouTube or TV is not an escape from the tech world and </em><strong><em>won’t make you feel refreshed</em></strong><em>. Anything that </em><strong><em>gets your blood pumping</em></strong><em> will.</em>

            <p>‍</p>
            <p>If you’re reading this then you’re probably thinking about&nbsp;going freelance, <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/how-to-become-a-web-developer" target="_blank">becoming a web developer</a>,&nbsp;or best of all, some combination of the two. You've done all the hard work and <a href="http://blog.careerfoundry.com/web-development/learn-to-code/" target="_blank">learnt to code</a>, but now it's time to reap some of the rewards that having these in-demand skills can offer you.</p>
            <p>It’s a good idea! But, err, how?</p>
            <p>more</p>
            <p>You could have a number of reasons for making the decision to break out of the corporate machine, but if you’re looking for examples, here are four that you might have considered while sitting at your desk job, imagining all the creative ways of saying "I quit!":</p>
            <p>1. A better work-life balance: You can have breakfast with your boyfriend/girlfriend again!</p>
            <p>2. Being your own boss:&nbsp;You can work all morning (or all night for that matter), and then spontaneously take a couple of days off to, I don’t know, play disc golf?</p>
            <p>3. Freedom to choose your working hours/clients/rate of pay:&nbsp;Say a polite ‘no thank you’ to that miserable client and a ‘no thank you’ to his criminally low budget too.</p>
            <p>4. The chance to work on more interesting projects:&nbsp;No more monotony, each month bringing a variety of work, clients and opportunities. Cue envious looks from your former colleagues.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you’ve already trained in Ruby On Rails, or you learned HTML at college, or you’re a dab hand at Java. If so, now could be the perfect time to join the freelance movement and become your own boss.</p>
            <p>[Sidenote: if you haven’t learned to code yet, then that should be your first order of business! Check out the <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/courses/become-a-web-developer" target="_blank">CareerFoundry Web Development Course</a> , and once you’ve learned a bit, come back and read this post again!]</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
              <div><img src="images/684Who_should_consider_freelancing_as_an_option-.jpg">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Who should consider freelancing as an option?</p>
            <p>If you’re a developer already, in all likelihood you’ve been working for the same company, or bouncing from opportunities year by year, leaving every time something that started out fascinating became quickly mundane. For a while now you’ve been thinking about calling your own shots, and breaking away from your circular work life.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if you’re a tech junky looking for a way to build a skillset that allows you to work on your own terms, this is a pretty stellar option.</p>
            <p>Being your own boss has a huge number of advantages, and not just because you get to decide the theme for the office Christmas party (Jumanji, anyone?) but getting started is tough.</p>
            <p>As a freelance web developer you put yourself in a high value position, but only for as long as you are able to run your own business, which includes managing the worst kind of employee you know… you!</p>
            <p>Just kidding, but let’s face it, self discipline is tough when your other options are watching movies on your sofa with a box of cookies. You have to be strict, but in case you need the motivation, here are a few things about being a freelance developer that work to your advantage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your skills are highly sought-after in every industry (AKA lots of demand)</li>
              <li>There is a huge shortage of web developers worldwide (AKA lots of demand)</li>
              <li>Contract salaries are frequently high (AKA … awesome!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think this might be the career choice for you? Thought so. Then let’s get you started!&nbsp;</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center">
              <div><img src="images/684Find_your_niche.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <h3>1. Find your niche</h3>
            <p>Wanna stand out from the crowd? Find yourself a niche, find a <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/how-to-become-a-web-developer" target="_blank">web development course</a> and upgrade your skills. While it’s great to be a programmer that can do a bit of everything, your value will be higher as an expert in just a few.</p>
            <p>“Becoming known as the solution to a particular set of problems is crucial to your freelance career, so you need to be willing to differentiate and then lock it in.” - Ted Johnson, longterm freelance developer</p>
            <p>If you’re not sure your current abilities solve a common enough problem, consider learning a new language altogether, or try building a skillset of complementary abilities other than coding. &nbsp;We have a&nbsp;<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-ux-designer" target="_blank">UX Design Course</a>, or <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-ui-designer" target="_blank">UI Design Course</a> for the more creative types. A developer who can also plan out a usable and effective information architecture is rare, and this dual-skilled approach could see you turning clients away left, right and centre.</p>
            <p>You don’t ever just want to be “that developer guy/girl I know” but rather “an expert developer for [insert problem here]”. It’ll be much easier to advertise your skills and make a name for yourself if you can say you’re the best in a particular, sought-after area, or the only one who can do it.</p>
            <p>Not sure what’s hot on the market right now? Here are the three most up and coming programming languages&nbsp;you’ll find today:</p>
            <p>Ruby on Rails</p>
            <p>Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework which runs via the Ruby programming language. Currently the hottest of the hot among startups worldwide.</p>
            <p>Swift</p>
            <p>Swift is Apple’s new innovative programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Structured for iOS development, syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast.</p>
            <p>Node.js</p>
            <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Many argue it is the up-and-coming competitor to Ruby on Rails.</p>
            <p>As our friend and expert web developer <a href="http://aestheticio.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Young </a>put it:</p>
            <blockquote>“Focus on the underlying principles and driving forces behind new technologies.”</blockquote>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Start building - anything and everything</h3>
            <p>So you’ve found your niche. Now it’s time to get building. The best place to start is your portfolio website, the one website you will update, edit and continually develop for your entire career.</p>
            <p>Your portfolio is a way of displaying your skills and having an easy reference for potential clients. If in doubt, remember that your goal in self-representation is to be easy to find, easy to remember, and good to know. You can read more about this in my article&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.careerfoundry.com/career-change/successful-freelancer/" target="_blank">My Secrets To Becoming A Successful Freelancer (And How You Can Get Out Of Your Desk Job In 30 Days</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But once you’ve published your CV, previewed samples of your past and added a contact form, what should you do?</p>
            <p>Build your ideas, they are what make you, you!&nbsp;Once you’ve built your portfolio, you need things to put in it, which is your opportunity to boost your personal brand by:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Practicing your niche skill</li>
              <li>Building your own ideas</li>
              <li>Exhibiting your technical chops</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’re essentially killing two birds with one stone: you’re improving on and applying your new skills while simultaneously showing your wares. Your portfolio is your shop window, so make sure that it, and its contents, represent your very best work.</p>
            <p>And if you want help making it better, help others! Keep a blog that explains your process, ask and answer questions on social media build, build, build every day. A great example of this is here: <a href="http://joshuakemp.blogspot.de/2013/11/how-blacksmith-learned-to-code-and-9.html" target="_blank">Confessions Of An Unlikely Developer</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Build your personal brand</h3>
            <p>Getting your name out there as an expert in the field can be tough, but if you want the freelance lifestyle, you’ll have to hustle for it, so get ready for some sleepless nights.</p>
            <p>There are so many opportunities for professionals to get known without spending a penny that advertising is not a route you need to go down, not at this stage. By showcasing your work, building a network and teaching and blogging like an expert you will find more than enough ways to connect with people and for people to find you.</p>
            <p>It’s crucial that you talk to people. Online and off.</p>
            <p>The internet, as you may know, is a marvellous marketing tool. There are so many opportunities for creating and building on new relationships that with a little tact your voice will quickly become vastly superior to any ads you’ll produce. Always keep in mind that you’ll have to talk to a lot of people to find and land clients, so get used to it!</p>
            <p>As professional freelancer Rebecca Shapiro told us:</p>
            <blockquote>"Make sure that you seek freelancers outside of your industry, as well. Be as far reaching as possible. Go into building these relationships with an attitude of giving instead of getting and you'll find you've easily built a reciprocal referral network."</blockquote>
            <p>From a visibility standpoint, keep your goals simple. Getting <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/105679166756477816414/+Dobranch/posts" target="_blank">Google</a> to find you if you have a normal name can be tough, so focus on attaching your name across your portfolio, social profiles and content to the terminology of your niche skill, and the problems your clients will search for.</p>
            <p>To kick it off, here are some great websites for online marketing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> - create a following by tweeting about current news in your niche, having conversations with people in your field and answering questions.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora </a>- answer questions from people interested in your niche. Make these as detailed as possible: the more content you write the more likely Google is to associate your name with web development.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> - create online tutorials and upload them using YouTube. Put them on your own website. Give them easy-to-Google titles like: “What is ” or, “How to ….” so that people can easily find them when they search. Try to make them personal and funny - without going too far off-topic - the more watchable they are the more people will come back to you for more videos.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally, a great opportunity for web developers to build a brand with is teaching. There are thousands of opportunities across the web for building, writing and mentoring in your particular niche, including <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en" target="_blank">our own platform.</a>

            <h3>4. Get organised</h3>
            <p>Becoming a freelance web developer is not just about knowing how to code. It’s about being a project manager, a sales person and head of customer care. You might not have had much experience in these areas but they are just as crucial to the success of your freelancing career as anything you can do with your programming skills. This means you need to get organised!</p>
            <p>Check out these time and project management tools and you'll see how things have moved on since the days of the Filofax.</p>

            <p>Do your research, ask friends, colleagues and other freelancers what they use.</p>
            <p>Josh Boyd, longterm freelancer and <a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk/" target="_blank">writer for Crunch</a>, gave us his advice:</p>
            <blockquote>"The most useful thing I realised about freelancing was not to despair when things went a bit wrong. New tax forms to fill out and late-paying clients would make me reconsider, but it's worth remembering freelancing is meant to be a challenge. If it were easy, it wouldn't be half as rewarding."&nbsp;</blockquote>

            <h3>5. Build up your experience, project by project</h3>
            <p>Now that you’ve got that new, in-demand skill under your belt and a slick website, it’s time to do some real projects to show potential clients. <a href="http://www.elance.com/" target="_blank">Elance</a>, <a href="http://www.odesk.com/" target="_blank">oDesk</a> and <a href="http://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank">Freelancer.com</a> are great online marketplaces for newbies in the field to start taking on jobs and gaining experience. Do this while you’re still in your fulltime job to get a feel of the amount of time you'll need and what you can realistically start to earn per project. While you are still finding your feet, experience is what counts.</p>
            <p>It’s a learning curve…</p>
            <p>You are still very much in the learning process here: Learning how to be a business person and a freelancer. Use this step as a chance to learn how to handle clients, to find out what they will expect from you.</p>
            <p>It might also be worth doing projects for local charities, schools or small businesses who simply can’t afford to pay a web developer’s rate. As Joshua Kemp writes in his blog, <a href="http://joshuakemp.blogspot.de/" target="_blank">Confessions Of An Unlikely Developer</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>“Find a friend with a TINY small business (any business), or you can just find a crappy old site that needs a serious facelift.”</blockquote>
            <p>By doing this you are building up your portfolio and getting great references for your CV; crucially, you'll learn how to deal with people.</p>

            <h3>6. My last piece of advice? Be brave</h3>
            <p>Let’s face it, when you start out you’re not going to be an expert in your field. You may take on projects that you aren’t sure how you’re going to finish. If that’s the case, if you’re not 100% confident of how you’re going to complete a project...</p>
            <p>Give your client a realistic idea of when they can expect that work back.</p>
            <p>If you tell them it’s going to take longer than they expect it’s better you tell them that now than when the deadline has passed. No one likes (bad) surprises. Particularly people who are paying you to do something.</p>
            <p>Our reliable friend <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> can help you with almost every kind of programming query you have, as well as websites like <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>. But don’t let lack of confidence stop you from taking on these bigger projects. It’s how you’ll develop as a freelancer and how you’ll learn your trade.</p>

            <p>Summary: How do you become a freelance web developer?</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Find your niche</li>
              <li>Build, build, build</li>
              <li>Get your name out there and establish a network of other freelancers and industry professionals, as well as rebuilding links with previous colleagues and employers</li>
              <li>Do some research into and invest in some decent management and invoicing software</li>
              <li>Start getting experience every which way you can until you’re ready to….</li>
              <li>Take on your first big client.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It’s not easy. It’s damned hard work. But the rewards of the freelance lifestyle will outweigh all of this hard work by 100 times if you do it&nbsp;"right" from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Building your reputation as a hard worker, a reliable, honest web developer who treats his or her clients well will pay off time and time again as you continue along your freelance journey.</p>
            <p>Word of mouth recommendations are worth a hundred of any advertisement you could pay for. So don’t take short cuts. Don’t rush a project or treat any client better or worse than the next one. Get as much experience as you can and always, always do a good job.</p>

            <p><em>The concept that launched a thousand site redesigns. For years, web designers have coveted print for its precision layouts, lamenting the varying user contexts on the web that compromise their designs.

            <p>As we’ve adopted responsive design—componentizing our interfaces, establishing breakpoints, and thinking content-out instead of canvas-in—we’ve learned that there’s more to it than just changing our techniques. We have to change the way we talk about (and act on) the principles of good responsive design. In this excerpt from Chapter 5 of his new book, Responsive Design: Patterns &amp; Principles, Ethan Marcotte explores the philosophical and practical frameworks that can guide our responsive work.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Every organization is different, with their own internal processes, stakeholder needs, and customer expectations—meaning that there’s no one right way to approach a responsive redesign project.

            <p>by <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/hj_chen" target="_blank"><strong>Chen Hui Jing</strong></a> · October 06, 2015&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;The rise of responsive web design sent designers and developers scrambling to figure out how best to deliver responsive images across a range of device widths. Thanks in large part to efforts by the Responsive Issues Community Group (RICG), we can now serve images of varying quality depending on the user’s viewport rather than on some convoluted server-side setup. Chen Hui Jing introduces us to the new image selection types and shows us how we can make them work for us.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Responsive web design changed everything about how we think and work on the web—and five years on, we’re still exploring the best ways to approach our practice. If we want a web that is truly universal, we must consider our users, our medium, and our teams in new, adaptable ways. Looking at where we’ve come from and where we’re going, Paul Robert Lloyd proposes a philosophical framework for our work on the responsive web.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Displays that are more tiny than our lowest-size breakpoints require a more condensed range of type sizes. If you don’t already have in place a typographic system that can absorb the demands of this new context (watches, <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/readable-wearables" target="_blank">wearables</a>, digital sticky notes, whatever), now might be the time to consider it. Matt Griffin was ready for anything because his site was simple and built to be future friendly.</p>

            <p>by <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/Aetherpoint" target="_blank"><strong>Andrew Johnson</strong></a> · January 20, 2015&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;We all want to design great typographic experiences—while serving users on a huge array of devices. But today’s type is inflexible and doesn’t scale. We can solve this problem by making webfonts more systemized and context-aware, and live web font interpolation—the modification of a font’s design in the browser—can help us get there. Andrew Johnson points the way.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;We should build websites that are not merely <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/planning-for-performance" target="_blank">responsive</a>, but sustainable, globally accessible, and, well, responsible, as Scott Jehl suggests in his new book, Responsible Responsive Design. Our approaches to responsive websites need to consider ever-changing devices, limited networks, and unexpected contexts. In this excerpt from Chapter 3, Scott discusses page load times and the responsible delivery of code.</p>

            <p>by <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/eportis" target="_blank"><strong>Eric Portis</strong></a> · November 04, 2014&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;When we design responsively, our content elegantly and efficiently flows into any device. All of our content, that is, except images. For years, we’ve catered to users with the highest-resolution screens by sending giant images to everyone. No longer. Eric Portis takes us through the new picture element and other attributes to let us mark up multiple, alternate sources. Find out how to use responsive images now: send the best image for each context, cut down on page weight, and speed up performance.</p>

            <h3><strong>Can Email Be Responsive?</strong></h3>
            <p><em>by</em> <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/JasonRodriguez" target="_blank"><strong><em>Jason Rodriguez</em></strong></a> <em>· May 13, 2014</em>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Love it or hate it, there’s no denying the popularity of HTML emails. And, like the web before it, the inbox has officially gone mobile, with over 50 percent of email opens occurring on mobile devices. Still, email design is an outrageously outdated practice. (Remember coding before web standards became… standards?) But coding an email doesn’t need to be a lesson in frustration. While email designers still have to build layouts using tables and style them with HTML attributes and—gasp!—inline styles, a number of intrepid designers are taking modern techniques pioneered for the web and applying them to the archaic practice of email design. Jason Rodriguez shows how to apply the principles of responsive web design to the frustrating but essential realm of email design.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It’s easy to see that <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/look-at-the-big-picture" target="_blank">automation</a> can streamline image-optimization for all the varied contexts on the pan-device web. What’s harder to imagine is a future where foregrounding meaningful content in images can be handled by an algorithm. Art direction still requires human intervention, and that’s often a luxury in high-production environments.</p>

            <p>by <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/nathanford" target="_blank"><strong>Nathan Ford</strong></a> · March 25, 2014</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Grids serve well to divide up a predefined canvas and guide how content fits onto a page, but when designing for the web’s fluid nature, we need something more responsive. Enter ratios, which architects, sculptors, and book designers have all used in their work to help set the tone for their compositions, and to scale their material from sketch to final build. Designers can apply a similar process on the web by focusing on the tone and shape of our content first, then working outward to design fluid, ratio-based grid systems that invite harmony between content, layout, and screen. Nathan Ford takes the next step toward more sophisticated, content-focused layouts on the web.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;We keep using that word, “responsive,” but do we all mean the same thing by it? The debate continues, as it should, while the word in its web context works its way into our language. But by the time its meaning coalesces, will we even need it anymore?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;We assume our users are like us—with the latest devices, the most recent software, and the fastest connections. And while we may maintain a veritable zoo of older devices and browsers for testing, we spend most of our time building from the comfort of our modern, always-online desktop devices. But what happens when our users descend into the subway, board a plane, go to live in the country, or just happen to find themselves in the wrong corner of the room? The truth is, offline is a fact of life—but there are ways to design for it. Alex Feyerke tells all.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;We’ve been designing responsively for more than three years, now, and have the small-screen pattern libraries and portfolios to prove it. But what about larger screens? While we commonly use liquid design for smaller breakpoints, allowing our content to expand and contract as needed, few of us consider what happens beyond a maximum width of 960 pixels or so—which can leave a heap of unused pixels on a contemporary desktop display. Mike Pick explores how to use negative space, scale, density, and layout devices such as grids, modules, and columns to break through the 1024-pixel layout barrier.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Not many newsrooms have the wherewithal to produce their own “Snow Fall,” and that, some say, dooms the NYT’s experiment to becoming a mere blip in the history of periodical web design. But it’s not all about per-article cost-effectiveness. The ambition that drives these efforts is exactly what the publishing business needs.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;When you step into the room with a client, you are a visitor from the future. You, web professional, spend your days immersed in the new paradigms of the multi-device web. Yet even for you, the constant change and adjustments that come with living on the internet can feel overwhelming. So how do you think your clients feel? It’s time to shed the vestigial mindsets we’ve inherited from the advertising world—the closed communications and drama of the “big reveal”—and build new systems based on honesty, inclusion, and genuine communication, says Matt Griffin. In this way, our clients will become true partners—rather than confused, anxious bystanders—as we learn to better navigate this strange, evolving digital universe together.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Text, navigation, and tables, oh, my! What’s a responsive web designer to do? How can you confine your design to as few major breakpoints as possible? Where and when will you sketch minor breakpoints? How should you think about content while sketching? Is it possible to sketch on actual devices, and what are the accessibility implications of doing so? The answers to these and other profound questions will be found in this exclusive excerpt from Chapter 7 of Responsive Design Workflow, Stephen Hay’s new book, available now from New Riders.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Web maps have come a long way. A ubiquitous and critical component of many apps, they’ve also become one of the mobile space’s most successful transplants. The core web map UI paradigm itself—a continuous, pannable, zoomable surface—has even spread beyond mapping to interfaces everywhere. Yet nearly five years since Paul Smith’s landmark article, “Take Control of Your Maps,” web maps are still a blind spot for most web designers. It’s time to integrate maps into our designs in powerful, creative, progressively enhanced new ways. Young Hahn starts us on the journey to map mastery.</p>
