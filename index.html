            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>

            <p>Communicating via typefaces. Fonts and layout. Designing for readers. Legibility. Web Fonts: there’s life after Georgia and Verdana. Using CSS @font-face to embed licensed fonts on your site. Typekit and other solutions. Controlling web typography: size, font, color. CSS methods, browser problems, user problems, and workarounds.

            <blockquote>“How do we deal with accessibility needs for which there are no definitive answers?”&nbsp;</blockquote>
            <p>asks Eleanor Ratliff. Sometimes we arrive at a fix that helps one group of people only to find that our solution undermines another group’s experience. Through the prism of typeface choice, Ratliff relates how she and her team tackled the problem of accessibility whack-a-mole for a rebranding project.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/spartan" target="_blank">Richard Fink</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;September 06, 2016</p>
            <p>Richard Fink first wrote about webfonts for A List Apart in 2010. Back then, those of us making the web were itching to break away from so-called “web-safe” fonts. And break away we did: by 2016, roughly 60 percent of sites were reportedly using webfonts, up from just two percent in 2011. Webfonts and, by extension, web typography, have blossomed. So surely no one would argue for a return to system fonts, right? Wrong. This article teases apart the arguments for and against.</p>

            <p>Type on the web has come a long way since the beginning of the decade. We now have literally thousands of fonts at our disposal to use on our sites. But the same faces—the Futuras, the Gothams, the Proxima Novas—crop up everywhere. Jeremiah Shoaf encourages us to break out of our cognitive ruts and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-rich-typefaces-get-richer" target="_blank">explore</a> the wealth of typographic diversity at our fingertips.</p>

            <p>The dog days are upon us—but instead of giving up in the summer swelter, take heart! We’ve got an extra-special reading list of bright, insightful brainfood. ALA’s third annual summer reader explores what’s been on the web industry’s mind lately, from accessibility to performance, from CSS techniques to web type, from mentorship to more collaborative approaches. It’s a list as cool and fancy as a watermelon-basil popsicle. Yeah, that does sound good, doesn’t it? Kick back, chill out, and get to reading.</p>

            <p>Displays that are more tiny than our lowest-size breakpoints require a more condensed range of type sizes. If you don’t already have in place a typographic system that can absorb the demands of this new context (watches, wearables, digital sticky notes, whatever), now might be the time to consider it. Matt Griffin was ready for anything because his <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/readable-wearables" target="_blank">site</a> was simple and built to be future friendly.</p>

            <p>by&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/author/Aetherpoint" target="_blank">Andrew Johnson</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;January 20, 2015</p>
            <p>We all want to design great typographic experiences—while serving users on a huge array of devices. But today’s type is inflexible and doesn’t scale. We can solve this problem by making webfonts more systemized and context-aware, and live web font interpolation—the modification of a font’s design in the browser—can help us get there. Andrew Johnson points the way.</p>

            <p>When you read, you filter text through your experiences and past conversations. You put words into context. You interpret. So how can we use typography to welcome readers and convince them to sit with us through this process? A List Apart alum Jason Santa Maria explains in this excerpt from Chapter 1 of On Web Typography, his new book from A Book Apart.</p>

            <p>A style guide, also referred to as a pattern library, is a living document that details the front-end code for all the elements and modules of a website or application. It also documents the site’s visual language, from header styles to color palettes. In short, a proper style guide is a one-stop guide that the entire team can reference when considering site changes and iterations. Susan Robertson shows us how to build and maintain a style guide that helps everyone from product owners and producers to designers and developers keep an ever-changing site on brand and on target.</p>

            <p>For ideal <a href="http://alistapart.com/column/responsive-typography-is-a-physical-discipline" target="_blank">typography</a>, web designers need to know as much as possible about each user’s reading environment. That may seem obvious, but the act of specifying web typography is currently like ordering slices of pizza without knowing how large the slices are or what toppings they are covered with.</p>

            <p>Minimalism in design has been around for some time, and today it seems to be a welcome alternative to overly busy and unnecessarily cluttered websites, posters, ads, and logos. For those new to this art form, the concept of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">minimalism</a>&nbsp;is mostly concerned with stripping away excess and strategically placing remaining elements. The result can be a calming, yet powerful design that is streamlined to convey its message. You can find minimalism in all art forms, from architecture to fashion to logo design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>To get the most out of a minimalist design, whether it be for something as small as a logo or large as a billboard, be sure to use the right elements correctly. Color, layout, white space, graphics &amp;&nbsp; typography all play an important role in minimalism. Below we look at these&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/06/13/how-to-design-learn-the-basics/" target="_blank">principles of design</a>&nbsp;and how they relate to minimalism.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalist Color Choices</strong></h3>
            <p>In minimalist design, color choice is strategic and the amount of colors used, should be kept to a minimum. Black, grey and white are the most powerful colors and allow for a single accent color to have a greater impact.</p>
            <p>All colors are acceptable if they are used properly; however, the colors with the greatest contrast are generally used together. Therefore, most designers choose bold and bright primary colours for minimalist design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Effective Minimalist Layout</strong></h3>
            <p>A minimalist design layout is especially challenging because every element with which you are working, is essential. Content for&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2011/03/01/web-design-tips-advice-from-a-to-z/" target="_blank">websites</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2008/05/13/how-to-design-a-movie-poster-with-an-example/" target="_blank">posters</a>&nbsp;should be laid out in such a way that the viewer can find what they need without much thought. In other words, the page should make sense.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/14_jan-reichle-website-500x232.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>White Space</strong></h3>
            <p>Negative space serves to give power to the small bits of information that it surrounds. The greater the empty space, the more power an object within it gains.&nbsp;<a href="http://justcreative.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/" target="_blank">Negative space</a>&nbsp;also serves to structure a group of elements and create balance.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Graphics</strong></h3>
            <p>The use of images in minimalism is very intentional. Designers choose graphics for their effectiveness and in minimalist design use them when the image is more effective than a written message. Graphics should be used sparingly and strategically, and should be relevant to the topic.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>Typography in minimalism should be just as strategic as any other element. In any design including minimalism, no more than two or three styles of fonts are appropriate. Many designs use one font for headlines, one for body, and possibly one for navigation on websites or for any special text or subheadings. Usually more than three types makes the design look cluttered and hard to understand.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="">

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3><strong>Minimalism on the Web</strong></h3>
            <p>In the last ten years, minimalist website design has become quite trendy. Unfortunately, some designers have misunderstood the idea behind minimalism and create web pages void of content that simply don’t make sense. However, at the root of the minimalist movement, great designers have created stunning websites that are not only pleasing to look at, but are also easy to navigate. While minimalist design is not practical nor thematically possible for every every website, those websites that can use it should take advantage.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>

              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in the Media</h3>
            <p>Brochures, packaging, and ad campaigns have all seen their share of the minimalist design. However, it is in posters and logos that you see it really take hold. Many designers choose to use this streamlined design for everything from movie posters, to band posters, to ad posters. The reason for this is the effectiveness of conveying a strong message quickly and cleanly. Used correctly, minimalist posters are designed to use each of its elements to send one message. The result is usually a poster that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism in logos</h3>
            <p>Minimalism in&nbsp;<a href="http://logooftheday.com/" target="_blank">logos</a>&nbsp;is an important concept, since the purpose of a logo is to be easily remembered and associated with a company. As a result, minimalist logos are often the most popular type of logo design since it keeps the logo simple enough to be memorable. The tricky part of a minimalist logo is to make a design that is easily recognised for the company it represents, while also reflecting the brand’s goals.</p>

            <h2>How to Create a Timeless Design: 7 Tips</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>The best designs never really go out of style. These classics are often rooted deep in design theory and have that certain something that helps them withstand the test of time. You know some of them – brands such as Nike and Coca-Cola have logos, colors and overall design personalities that have stood for decades.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Thankfully, that timeless concept is something you can apply to almost any project. You might not have the same visual recognition as the Swoosh, but you can create an aesthetic that can work for you for years to come. Here’s how to do it.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>1. Focus on Readable Content</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/rainn.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>It starts with readable type, images and overall clarity in the design and message. While that sounds like a tall order, a focus on simplicity and readability are key.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typography needs to be readable at any size and without difficulty. Novelty typefaces can be fun for a while, but if users don’t know what you are trying to say, the design will fall short.</li>
              <li>Images should be sharp, of high quality and easy to understand. Just as typography needs to be readable, all other visuals must be read as well. Can the user understand what is happening in the image and how it relates to what you are trying to say?</li>
              <li>The design needs to look good, but should provide a clear message or meaning. Images, text and user actions should create an integrated experience that users understand and want to be a part of. If the parts are asynchronous and disjointed, even a beautiful design can fail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. Incorporate Interactivity</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/bangui.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Once you put all the visual elements together, users should want to interact with it. This doesn’t mean you have to create a virtual reality experience – although you could. Even small touches of interaction can make a design feel more realistic and add to the personality of the project.</p>
            <p>When thinking about interactive elements, design for usability and usefulness. Interactivity should do something that can’t be done in another way. It might be how you tell a story, a thoughtful navigation pattern or a bit of movement or action just to delight users.</p>
            <p>Set a goal for the interactive visual, keep it simple and smooth and make sure it works with your content plan for maximum impact.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>3. Create a Visual Scale</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/wekiwi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Every website needs a hierarchy of elements. Big items, regular-sized elements and small pieces. Each of these elements needs a place in the design with plenty of space to differentiate it from other parts of the visual display.</p>
            <p>A good visual scale provides a way to proportionately design and place elements – from type to space to size – so that everything seems to fit in a logical manner.</p>
            <p>A good scale creates flow in a pattern that’s easy for the user to recognize and work with. (There’s a reason that most website have a left-top logo, large image and then body text. It provides a visual scale that shows users how to read the content.)</p>
            <p>Just as important as the scale and weight of items are the consistency in use. If a button is one color and size on the homepage, it should have the same design on other pages. Body text, headlines and color choices should follow rules of consistency across pages as well.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. Accent Elements with Purpose</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/felt.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>The most lasting designs have a little something extra to set them off from everything else. Accent elements with a purpose, use color in interesting ways and include touches of flair that are a little more modern and keep the design from feeling stark.</p>
            <p>Accents include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Special bits of typography</li>
              <li>Interesting pops of color</li>
              <li>Simple animations</li>
              <li>An unusual texture of background</li>
              <li>Almost anything unexpected</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of accents as little surprises that help direct users through the design. They should provide direction and informational understanding about the content as well as provide visual interest.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h2>5. Establish Identity</h2>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/penguins.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Every part of your visual identity should look like your brand. This applies to everything from your website to business cards to photo and logos on social media. Users should know who you are just by looking and not have to wonder if they wandered into content by mistake.</p>
            <p>This brand identity is important – vital, actually. Creating a brand identity is a giant undertaking and if you don’t have one already, it should be on your radar. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help create visual identity and consistency.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the same colors.</li>
              <li>Stick to a handful of fonts and sizes.</li>
              <li>Consider alignment rules for text and pick a style.</li>
              <li>Establish a photo style – color vs. black and white vs. another technique.</li>
              <li>Stick to the same voice for messaging – formal vs. casual.</li>
              <li>Be yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>6. Forget the Gimmicks</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/babygi.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Designs that are too trendy can fade out of fashion fast. They can also date the design so it looks like it came from a certain time period. That’s not to discourage the use of trends, though; just use them smartly.</p>
            <p>Timeless design patterns are rooted in design theory. Basic principles and guidelines shape how the visual outline comes together. Consider that in relationship to trends. How well do they mesh? One of the reasons Material Design concepts – a big trend – seems to work so well is that it is rooted in physical ideals and motion. It takes a two-dimensional idea and pushes it forward.</p>
            <p>Using a specific typeface, complicated plugin or animation or color palette are visual ideas that you should think about. How long will the look fresh and relevant? Or do you have a plan to switch these elements out while keeping the rest of the design? You can be trendy and timeless!</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>7. Use a Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/aussie-ballet.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Proper organization never goes out of style. From a simple grid to a grid-based visual display, a strong grill provides the foundation for a solid design.</p>
            <p>When thinking about and planning a grid, think vertically and horizontally. Often designers spend a lot of time on the columnar spacing and vertical issues lurk in the design. A good grid provides enough flexibility to create and place elements with ease in a way that create harmony and flow. It also provides a guideline for spacing (including white space) and alignment of elements and parts.</p>
            <p>The grid can influence every visual aspect of the design from the size of photos and type to how icons or buttons line up with other content. The grid can be as complicated or simple as the project dictates, but should be enforced with every design element to maintain visual consistency.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Timeless design isn’t about specific techniques; it is about making design choices that are balanced, logical and easy for users to comprehend. While trendy elements can be a lot of fun, more timeless projects use a mix of classic and modern elements to share information in a directed way.</p>
            <p>When you want to create something that will last a long time, the best idea is to go back to the basics. Almost all lasting design concepts are rooted in theories that have been used for a long time.</p>

            <h2>How Does a User See Design?</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s often a disconnect between the way a designer looks at a website or brochure or package and the way users see it. As a designer, you can appreciate trends and attention to typography and details in a way that the common user might not.</em>

            <p>Users only know whether they understand something when they interact with it. The details of how that interaction happens or why it is pleasing are often lost. It’s a pretty harsh reality.
            </p>
            <p>But there’s a nugget of wisdom in understanding that disconnect. If you think about what users are thinking, you will be a better designer. (Even if you don’t particularly like their thoughts on design.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Typography is Good or Bad</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/prototyze-the-year-of-the-incubator.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Designers love typography. Beautiful characters. Long swashes. Serifs with charm.</p>
            <p>Sadly, many users don’t know Arial from Helvetica. (Nor do they care.) When it comes to type, users know one thing. Can they read it?</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean you can forget lettering in projects. It actually means quite the opposite. You need to pay even more attention to it. To keep users interested, every word, paragraph and headline must be perfectly readable. Users should not have to concentrate or think about the words to decipher them.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to ensure that words are clear, spacing is adjusted properly and every bit of the message is on clear display.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Color Often Goes Unnoticed</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/studio-dot.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Users don’t pay as much attention to color as you might expect. While designers may ponder over the difference between periwinkle and coneflower for hours, the casual user will often see blue.</p>
            <p>Now here’s the caveat: If a color changes dramatically, say from blue to yellow, users will notice. When it comes to color, big shifts in hue are what users tend to focus on.</p>
            <p>The thing that’s difficult about color is perception. People bring so many different notions and ideas to color choices. Make sure you have a general idea of common color associations and pair color in a way that’s accessible to all – consider choices that are visible for those that don’t see color well – for the safest color combinations.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Buttons Need to Be Obvious</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/alex-kot.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>There was an almost fatal flaw in ghost button trend: Users did not see the button when interacting with the design. It almost seemed to fade into the background.</p>
            <p>While this has shifted somewhat over time, and as ghost buttons became more popular, it was a real problem (and still can be in some instances). Super-trendy elements that look different from what users expect can lead to lost conversions.</p>
            <p>Calls to action – forms, buttons, links – need to obvious and follow common user patterns for the most success. Users have short attention spans and won’t stick around to “learn” an unconventional design. Make it easy for them.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Minimalism is ‘Overrated’</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/simone-viola-design-studio.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Admit it. Minimalism is one of your favorite go-to design options.</p>
            <p>While some users appreciate this simple beauty, more often it feels stark to them. “Where is everything?” they might ask.</p>
            <p>This can be a difficult hurdle to overcome. You’re likely to see this pushback in the early stages of design when working with clients that are always asking to put more “stuff” in the design – more photos, more color, more text.</p>
            <p>Try to strike a balance with nice open spaces and clean lines that don’t feel cluttered. The end result might not be purely minimal, but will be more pleasing to the client and end user.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>Big Images Take Up a Lot of Space</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/brave.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>A large, interesting image will grab a user’s attention like few other things. But users don’t always agree with this statement.</p>
            <p>This is one of those situations where the user doesn’t know what they don’t know. It’s hard to compare a design with small images versus oversized options. The difference in impact is often clear for someone with that design eye.</p>
            <p>This is where you have to sell it to clients in the best interest of users. Go back to the theory that magazines and newspapers have used for years – tell users what is important. A big photo or video or illustration does that. A group of small elements often does not have the same lasting impression.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to help figure out what that first impression is supposed to be with the design. What problem are you trying to solve? What does the user need to know right away? Therein lies the answer.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>They Know Branding</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/etecc-interactive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Everyday users know a lot more about branding than they are given credit for. A user will know of a brand changes color or if the font in the logo shifts. (They might not always be able to pinpoint what’s different, but will know something has changed.)</p>
            <p>Any shift in an established brand identity can be jarring and confusing to users. That’s why it is so important to follow established rules for how to represent a brand visually. (If you are not working for a style guide, it is time to develop one now.)</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>It Either Works or Doesn’t</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/percept-brand-design.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>Have you started to pick up on a common theme in what users perceive when they look at a design?</p>
            <p>It either works … or it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>Users seldom understand why. Users seldom care why a design works or not. If it works, they continue to engage. When it doesn’t, they abandon the design and move on to something else.</p>
            <p>It’s your job to be ahead of the user when it comes to what works or doesn’t. A good plan for user testing helps. More important are all of those design basics that you probably don’t think about. Design and color theory, user patterns, principles of typography and even speed and interaction design with websites and apps.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>It’s a lot to think about. You only thought you had to design something that looks good to you, right?</p>
            <p>The good thing that is that most clients often see the design like typical users. Many of these issues are at the root of conversations you are already having. Hopefully, now you can think about them a little differently and plan for what these users are thinking (and how to help improve the design so that it looks great to you … and them!)</p>

            <h2>5 Website Layout Ideas That Never Get Old</h2>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><em>There’s always that moment at the beginning of a website design project where you think “where do I start?” You’ll battle the desire to create something totally different and new versus something tested and reliable.</em>
            </p>
            <p>Realistically, there are a few layouts that just never get old. These patterns are generally accepted by users, easy to understand and provide a solid framework for pretty much any design and content type. Here, we’ll look at these five “timeless” website layouts and how to make the most of them for your next project.</p>
            <h3>1. Hero Image Stacked on Simple Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/armando.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>No matter the screen size, this format gives the user something to look at, scroll through and digest. While the actual specifications for this shape might changes based on device type or whether you prefer a full-width or shallow image, the sketch is roughly the same.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Hero image with text overlay</li>
              <li>2 to 4 columns with small information elements with or without icons</li>
              <li>Main body area</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The design is clean, provides a strong visual presence and tends to work well with responsive frameworks regardless of breakpoint. Some alternative applications of this format are to switch a static hero header for a slider or video header.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/rodesk.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Every element has a place and there is a logical flow to following the content. The main image is the first impression that should draw users into the design and secondary elements should make users want to click around.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add bright colored icons or boxes to the column-based informational elements, or use a flat style for the user interface elements throughout the design.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>2. One Page, One Column</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/pop-up.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>One page layouts are one of the best solutions for websites with minimal content and a single focus or message. When the message is simple, there’s not need to go crazy with the shape of the layout either. A one-column layout can be the perfect solution.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation</li>
              <li>Main body area with images and text</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using this design pattern, space is a vital design element. Ensure that elements have plenty of room between them and consider using exaggerated spacing on the outside edges of the design. The risk with a one-page website is that it can feel cramped or disorganized if spacing is out of whack.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The one-page formula is best-suited for small websites. It can make the lack of content on an introductory page or simple portfolio feel weightier than it is. The format also works well for simple blogs or content plans that stick to a single format.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Add parallax scrolling to make the page feel more engaging as users scroll. These simple effects can make a simple one-page design feel deeper and more robust (and like it actually has multiple pages with each flick of the mouse).</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>3. Defined Grid</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/seb.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Neatly stacked rows and columns of content never goes out of style. Whether the grid is built with plenty of small pieces or just a four-by-four arrangement, a clean grid tells your user something about you from the start. This content is organized, managed well and ordered for you.</p>
            <p>Grids are incredibly popular among designers for their own portfolio websites. What’s nice about an image grid is that you can showcase a lot of visual content without looking junky. This gallery effect can be quite impactful.</p>
            <p>Grids can also come in the form of colored boxes or containers to organize text. Grid lines can be visible or invisible. There are so many options to choose from. Just remember to take particular care with the width and depth of columns and rows and spacing in between each. These little details can make or break the entire design.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The organization a grid creates is hard to beat. A nice grid makes it easy for users to find and interact with content while creating visual harmony.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use simple bits of animation for a tiled grid so that a hover of click “flips” a grid block to show additional information. Want another option? Consider turning the grid into a card deck, featuring a Material Design style.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>4. The Classic F-Pattern</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/motive.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p>Research into the way people look at websites uncovered a particular flow known as the F-Pattern. The reading pattern showed that users start at the top of a website and read from left to right across the screen. Then they move down and read across again. Finally, they just skim to the bottom of the page in a straight line.</p>
            <p>Designing content in this F-Pattern is a way to help put the content that matters most right where users are looking. This concept translates into a common design outline.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header and navigation</li>
              <li>Wide left-hand column as the main content area</li>
              <li>Thin right-hand column (sidebar) for links and related information that doesn’t go to the bottom of the page</li>
              <li>Footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> People are creatures of habit, and this is a tested pattern that shows the way people think, look at and read websites. It’s comfortable and common, making it easy for users to understand and interact with.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Flip the location of the sidebar or turn the sidebar into the navigation area, or use a hero image on top of the F-shaped pattern.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h3>5. Minimal Layering</h3>
            <figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width: 100%;" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="">
              <div><img src="images/berkeley.jpg">
              </div>
            </figure>
            <p>‍</p>
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Layering can draw the eye to exactly the location where it matters most in the design. Particularly in concert with a simple overall design, this is the element that begs users to take notice. Layering on a minimal outline is a great way to showcase or highlight a particular piece of content or call to action.</p>
            <p><strong>Incorporate a trend:</strong> Use subtle gradients or shadows to define elements in different layers. While these design techniques fell out of fashion for a while, creating barely-there differentiation is making a major comeback, thanks to Material Design and a refocusing on creating something tactile in the two-dimensional space.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>When in doubt with any type of design, the best thing you can go is go back to the roots of design theory. Use classic ideas and principles to guide your decision-making.</p>
            <p>In most cases, this will result in something that’s clean, easy to read and follows conventional style. Once you have that basic framework complete, then you can add a trendy element to keep the layout looking fresh. Using ones of this layout philosophy will help you create a website that will withstand the test of time better without looking dated. (Now that you are thinking about it, you’ll probably start to notice how many websites actually use one of these concepts.)</p>

            <h2>Why Responsive Design?aaa</h2>
            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>

            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices.

            <blockquote>If you've built a web site in the past several years, you've probably heard of Responsive Design. Coined in 2010 by designer Ethan Marcotte, the term covers a set of techniques that allow one flexible web design to serve many different screen sizes.</blockquote>
            <p>In the years since it hit the scene, "responsive" has become the default choice for&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.aids.gov/2014/07/aids-gov-mobile-success-story.html" target="_blank">modern, mobile-friendly sites</a>. With that visibility, though, comes misunderstanding and controversy! Some proponents treat responsive design as a silver bullet for every project's tough problems, while detractors complain it will limit their grand vision. Some clients believe they have to choose between a responsive site or a native mobile app, as if one ruled out the other. And in a few frustrating situations, we've seen totally separate mobile, tablet, and desktop mockups passed off as a "responsive" approach.</p>
            <p>At Lullabot, we believe that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/responsive-adaptive-web-design">responsive design is a critical part of future-friendly web publishing</a>. Making the most of it requires understanding which problems it solves, which ones it doesn’t, and how it fits your project’s needs. In this article we'll take a look at how we build responsive sites, correct some common misconceptions, and explain the real benefits for your projects.</p>
            <h3>What is "Responsive," anyways?</h3>
            <p>Ethan Marcotte's&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">seminal article</a>&nbsp;and follow-up book define specific techniques that make a site responsive. Both make great reading for anyone who wants to dig into the details. At a high level, we can boil it down to a handful of principles.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>BUILD A FLUID, FLEXIBLE LAYOUT.</h4>
            <p>Ever since the first Photoshop mockup was used to sell a site design, web developers have been creating "fixed width" layouts that target specific screen sizes. When space-constrained mobile browsers hit the market, they had to create custom mobile sites with stripped-down designs. Responsive design starts with a layout that&nbsp;<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">stretches and squishes</a>&nbsp;to fit any screen, often relying on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/">percentages and ratios</a>&nbsp;rather than fixed sizes and positions.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>MEDIA QUERIES TWEAK ELEMENTS WHEN THE LAYOUT BREAKS.</h4>
            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>

            <p>Stretchable, squeezable fluid layouts can't cover every extreme: a design that looks great on a 27" desktop monitor might look impossibly cluttered on a 4" phone. Designers identify situations where the fluid design breaks, and use&nbsp;<a href="http://cssmediaqueries.com/">conditional CSS rules</a>&nbsp;to add special styling instructions for those "<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-breakpoints">breakpoints</a>." On a tall-but-skinny smartphone, for example, sidebars might be moved to the bottom of an article to leave more space for text. On a wide desktop screen, photo captions might be moved beside images to take advantage of the extra room.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>IMAGES AND MEDIA MUST BE FLEXIBLE.</h4>
            <p>Giant fixed-width images, embedded media players, and clunky widgets can all break your smooth, fluid layouts. Styling for these elements should use percentages and ratios, too—ensuring that they conform to fit the responsive layout they're placed in. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/">FitVid.js</a>and the new&nbsp;<a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-how-to-use-html5-picture-for-responsive-images--cms-21015">HTML Picture element</a>&nbsp;can make this part easier.</p>
            <p>‍</p>
            <h4>RESPOND TO CAPABILITIES, NOT SPECIFIC DEVICES.</h4>
            <p>The most important principle is simple: responsive design plans for scenarios and capabilities, rather than specific hardware devices. Instead of "sniffing" for iPhones and generating custom HTML and CSS, a responsive site uses one standard set of HTML. Conditional CSS rules and client-side scripts account for the special cases like low-resolution portrait displays, mobile devices with GPS capabilities, and so on. That ensures the design will respond intelligently to any device that matches the right criteria—including newly released ones—and the long tail of older devices often ignored by the latest design trends.</p>
            <p>Although device detection, tailored markup, and other techniques can be layered on top of a responsive design, a strong responsive foundation is the most reliable starting point.</p>
